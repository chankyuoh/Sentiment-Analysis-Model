No. I can't beleave anyone set out to make a film this bad. Makes me wonder what was left on the cutting room floor. It's to bad that Rate It! wont let me give it ZERO STARS."

There was very little resemblence of a real NASCAR race or race team in this movie. It is the worst movie ever about NASCAR. Tom Cruise was wooden. The rest of the cast could barely hold their own. The script was unbelievable for any NASCAR fan. The action sequences were filmed during an actual running of the Daytona 500. That is the entire highlight. Everything else is drivel.'

S"This movie was horrible and boring. I would not recommend this version of Time Machine to anyone. Don't bother renting the tape either, you'll just be wasting your money. Like most films made by Hollywood today, this one showed their anti-White nature. The Morlocks, the bad guys, had blond hair and their mind control leader was a glow-in-the-dark Aryan, who was also bad. According to this story, mankind evolved into two species, the dark skinned mixed race, who were portrayed as completely good in nature and the blond race creatures and their Aryan mind controller, who were portrayed as evil. The bad blonds ate the dark skinned people, but this was never shown. The 'hero' of this boring flick killed all the mutated Aryans and freed the mixed race from their horrible oppression of being food. Jewish hollywood never misses a chance to portray blonds in a negative manner. H.G.Wells would hate this version of his book since he was well aware of Aryan history (he wrote on the subject) and to see his movie take on anti-Aryan sentiments would have inflamed him. I may have described this film in an exciting way, but it was really dull and predictable even if you haven't read the book. The 'hero' uses his time machine to blow up all the bad people and then he stays in the future. The movie is also anti-technology by saying mankind took his knowledge too far. In the 'hero's' first couple of jumps into the future, he sees that mankind (Whites) destroyed the moon causing all society to collapse. All that is left in the far off future is the mixed race 'good people' and the mutated White 'bad' race. All the action parts of the film I mentioned were very brief, so don't go see the movie because of the narrative I spoke on. Basically this film was nothing more than anti-White, anti-technology propaganda with little entertainment value. No wonder it tanked at the box office. And, if you rent it, you will only be wasting your time. It's also no wonder movies do not offer a satisfaction guarantee."

Sure the premise of being able to see dead people is spooky and all but somewhere in there people seem to have gotten so swept up by the whole idea of it that they forgot how corny so much of it was with Bruce Willis walking around the city trying to sort out this little kids (and his own) problems. C'mon people work with me here. It was more of a drama than a horror movie. Oh no there's a pastey faced girl under my bed and she wants me to go deliver a box to Mommy and Daddy!!!! Oooohhhh. Now don't get me wrong if I found a pastey faced girl in a nightie hiding out under my bed you can bet I'd freak to the extreme but one things for sure you wouldn't catch me running errands for her. oh and while your out if you would be so kind as to stop off at mummy and daddys to drop of a little something for me I'd be ever so indebted to you "

S'Being a Southerner, I was truly hoping that Gods and Generals would be a good movie. Believe me -- I read the numerous negative reviews, but I decided to see the movie myself because I concluded that Yankees who did not appreciate Southern History wrote the reviews. However, seeing the movie was a huge mistake! I am not exaggerating when I say that Gods and Generals is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Anyone that tells you that this movie is great is in complete denial. The movie, at best, serves as a how to video for Civil War Re-enactors -- nothing more. Sitting through four boring and tedious hours of this movie was complete torture. Again, Southerners are depicted as arrogant far right wing extremist and religious zealots. With respect to Gods and Generals, do yourself a favor--STAY AT HOME!'

A great premise is waisted on cute and cliche teeny bop horror ploys that are so predictable even an unbore fetus could detect them. This film does however in the early moments give off a very creepy undertone. It keeps you hooked to the movie in hope throughout all the crap something genuinly scary and original will pop out and blow you away which unfortunatly never comes.

S'Dreadful, cheesy and corny "remake" of the original, which was a minor classic, and whatever else it may have been, and it was pretty cheesy in its own right, the original was a fairly unique and influential landmark in the development of sci- fi films. The makeup was indeed very good, and Tim Roth did a good job as usual, but the rest of this movie was atrocious. The plot in particular was abysmal.'

S'Hated it. This was my favourite chapter of the LOTR books, and Peter Jackson killed it. All the major parts of the novel were missing- at the end the Hobbits return to find that Saruman is in the Shire, and without Gandalf or Aragorn they clean the Shire of the evil men and Saruman (who tried to kill Frodo)- this is all missing.. It looks like Hollywood got their claws in this one- it made the new Star Wars movies look good. Maybe if you never read the books you could be taken away by the magnificent storyline- but this was Tolkiens work- not the movies. All the time wasting they did at the end with tearful goodbyes could have been utilised by showing the Hobbits battle in the Shire. Bad job- it spoiled the series for me. '

S"Early on, I realized that the title, among so many other things about this movie, was meant to be sarcastic. It's obvious from the opening scene that there is not going to be anything even remotely related to the word beauty involved. In fact, had its creators been looking for a more descriptive straightforward title they could easily have come up with The Ugly American . After the initial shot of ugly, my brain, conditioned for such occasions long ago in the 60's and 70's, starts telling me that I will now have to switch into the late 90's, hip, nihilistic, black comedy mode. Then I remember, Whoops! I think my warranty on this mode ran out sometime during the 80's! The result is that now, when I'm faced with this brand of tripe I find it harder and harder to forgive the movie makers for several things. Number one, I can't forgive them for insulting my intelligence crud is crud even when it wins three or more Oscars. Number two; I can't forgive them for taking my money in exchange for this crud even if I did wait to see it at a cheap seats theater. Number three - and this is the big one - I cannot forgive them for their basic statement that because they have found yet another artistic witty, and original way to present crud and, in the process, also managed to convince a panel of lost souls that they deserved national recognition for it, that we should all grow up and thank our lucky stars that these forward thinking artists have given us something with which to be entertained, educated and dog-gone-it, perhaps shed yet another layer of that pesky morality thing that seems to keep popping up as it continues to die. In other words, if you're really with the times you will genuflect to the golden statue as you swallow this crud regardless of the fact that it stinks on ice. Pardon me while I get my gag reflexes under control. Unable to ever switch into the proper mode, it was easy for me to see the direction and ultimate destination of American Beauty . It starts out ugly, moves quickly into even uglier and ends with a violent, crashing, ugly grand finale which makes War of the Roses (Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner) seem like a little, domestic squabble. Since viewers are treated to generous portions of perversion, violence, psychotic behavior, irritating teenage angst, pathetic mid-life crises, and a three-layer selection of dysfunctional families, there is a little ugliness for every age group and personal taste (or distaste). Add to this the fact that not one character in the entire film has even one redeeming characteristic or the ability to elicit the slightest bit of sympathy and you have yet another great reason to NOT go to the movie theater.

S'I am sorry but I have to disagree with every single one of these comments. Maybe if the ads for this movie were different the rating would be a 3. Everyone was saying this was the scariest movie since The Excorsist. Yeah, right. This is a zombie movie that was not scary at all. It seemed like every scene was pitch black. Its very difficult to find out what was happening. I love zombie movies, but this one showed how many zombies? 5? The zombies looked like normal people just with a little blood on thier face. The movie starts off horrid; animal rights activists cause the disease to spread. After that its good until the action starts, which is where it gets all dark. Finally, too many questions were unanswered. I hate that. This was a good idea at a modern day Night of the Living Dead, but turns out to be a non-scary, pitch black mess of a movie. Night of the Living Dead lives on!'

S"Overrated stinkorama. Some of the bad SCI-FI movies Mystery Science Theater 3000 makes fun of was better than this snorefest. Supposedly, the entire scenery and background was computer animated. If that's the case, then I was praying for the Blue Screen of Death to pop up and get me out of this. So utterly boring, the drab background was dull and unimaginative. Even the Fx stunk. The planes looked plain dumb. The story was like some 9th rate film noir by some rookie hack. Absolutely zero chemistry between Jude Law and Apple's mom. I used to like Jude Law (especially in Talented Mister Ripley), but his string of stinkers (Alfie, Closer, and this detritus) makes him the latest actor to go shark jumping. We may only remember him as the dude who stood next to Ashlee Simpson when she complained about acid reflux on SNL."

The characters and scenes are very surrealistic, almost to the point of existentialism, and the humorous portions of the film are rather transparent. The story is very predictable, and the special effects, mediocre. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, and while Chris Tucker was funny, he was also tedious and unnecessary. Additionally, the love story was thin, and under developed while Gary Oldman was just stupid: so much so, that I believe his performance in Lost in Space was better than this one.'

Why did the annoying guy from the Big Chill save the earth (Goldblum doing a dead on but dreadful impression of himself from that movie)? How can Will Smith drag an alien from Colorado to Utah and back to Nevada in one afternoon? Why did it take a hundred machine guns to kill that alien when Will knocked him out with one punch for two days last time? What was the point of teasing the Harry Conick, Jr. character without developing him enough that we should care that he died? Why are brain dead moviegoers so easily manipulated by things that go boom that they don't notice plot holes?

In the first movie, they handled the CG and special effects beautifully, but in this one, it seemed they slacked off quite a bit (not that I can do better, but that Scorpion at the end was mind-numbingly HORRIBLE!). And the zepplin . . . oh, that was a bad idea. And, since sais originate from the 1600's in Okinawa as a farming tool, it's kind of hard to accept that ancient Egypt possessed these things as weapons back then! Doing the face-in-the-sand thing in the first movie was kinda cool. Doing the face-in-the-water thing in this one was repetative. And, for the Rock fans--he's only in it for all of maybe two minutes, one of which is spent in a horrible CG replication of him. You'd be better off seeing Scorpion King if you want to see him. Altogether, if you want to watch it, by all means do so . . . just know that you've been warned!"

I can't believe that seventeen year old children can walk in off the street and see this film, for this our society's moral standards should be reviewed. One would have to agree that all played their roles well..they were all full of emotion and very dramatic. Still I just can't see how anyone would find a film that makes sex look so dirty, so amazingly good. Most at our show left appauled. Anyone who enjoys this movie would have to be slightly twisted and lacking something in their own sexual relations. I just really feel that this movie should have been rated NC-17."

They turn against the other child and fight for the mother's love. This movie was overwhelmingly boring, the last 20 minutes were probably the most meaningless moments of my life. I think that is what hell is like, you are forced to watch clips of movies that are long and boring and have no purpose. The only reason I went to see this movie is because my girlfriend's cousin, Jake Thomas, plays the human son. Even her family thought the movie was slow and stupid. I think it was well marketed, because if you remember the trailers basically left everything up to the imagination. Everybody assumed that Spielberg and Osmet would team up for a masterpiece, but it turned out to be a disaster."

NO chemistry between ANY of the cast/characters....very boring to a lame space music score which only amplifies the lack of a original story...not a single credible character to care about...RIDICULOUS scene where Michael D (the Dad) meets up with his daughters negro junkie dealer and does NOTHING about it !! pretty DUMB when he's the head of the top federal DEA type agency with dozens of agents at his disposal. The entire plot borders on the improbable....9 count em seconds of screen time for SALMA HAYAK?? wished they would have given her a couple of actual lines to say...the junkie teenage daugher miscast she isn't very pretty or believable....whoever wrote this TERRIBLE screenplay needs to have their WGA membership taken away !! again the WORST MOST BORING DOWNER MOVIE I can remember (but would LOVE to forget) in the past 5 years easily. -----Todd Michael Wiseman -----Ohio Univ College of Cinematography Film "

The only thing I give it credit for was it's advertising. It was a low budget film that did very well. It was a suspense film only to the extent that it kept you waiting for the suspense...but it never comes! The acting hurt this movie severely, horror movies just don't work with terrible acting. And as for that plot twist at the end, well, let me just say that for anyone who's seen Silence of the Lambs, I wasn't shocked in the least. Stop reading here if you really want to see this movie without knowing the ending. Let's think about it. What exactly would the purpose be of having a dead guy laying in the middle of the floor throughout the entire movie. Why is he there? There's not point unless...*gasp*...he's not really dead! Tricky tricky. And not that I like excess gore, but to credit yourself as being this terribly twisted movie, a few almost shots of a guy sawing his leg off and the aftermath of that jawbreaker thing that didn't do much...come on. I give this movie a big LAME for being so disappointing."

There is also sexual content (although not nearly as much as the worthless American Pie or the brain-dead Martin Lawrence: RunTelDat. And, of course, drug use and alcohol is present. But, what else would you expect from the writers of the stupid Beavis Butt-Head series on the network for brain-deads, MTV. Stay out of this office and run to a certain Federation starship, catch some Pokemon, or let it snow!'

The notion that they could do something like this is appaulling That did not need doing either. Jim Carrey plays him ok, but not what it should have been. They should learn from their mistakes and not do things like this. Twenty-two minutes is just right for the Dr. Seuss classic."

S"With Star Wars, George Lucas turned the film industry on its head. With Phantom Menace, George Lucas joined the rest of the film industry in its superficial marketing-fest. Phantom Menace does not have the uncorrupted feel of (the original 1977 version of) Star Wars. Episode I takes itself far too seriously. It has no wit, no great chemistry between the stars, and hardly any character development. The actors do very little to create sympathy. All that and barely enough plot to fill a midichlorian's left nostril. But what about all the great inside jokes? I hear you whine. What about them? If I want a bunch of gratuitous inside jokes, I'll watch the latest Disney movie. "

S"American Beauty was truly a great film, and one of the first times I've actually agreed with the Academy on the Oscar awards. I actually hadn't heard a lot of the hype surrounding it, because I saw it before the awards. A friend of mine just said American Beauty is great. Go see it! . I can say that it's definitely one of my favorites. You go through such a wide range of emotions from watching this film. There are many comedic parts to laugh at, and some classic lines (like the part where Lester writes about what he does at work). There are also parts where you feel rage or anger (how Ricky is treated by his dad, how shallow Angela seems to be, how much of a bitch Carol can be). It may be a bit of an over dramatization of how life in the suburbs can be, but it's not a far stretch and I really think it shows how bad it can be. People have some serious problems and try to cover it up with flowers, white picket fences, and other stuff . This makes me think of Andrea Yates, the woman who drowned her 5 children. The ending is great too. It's certainly gruesome, but it's not a complete surprise, due to the information Lester gives you in the beginning, and the mood of the story is actually one of hope, not of demise. Kevin Spacey is a brilliant actor...definitely my favorite. Annette Benning also does a superb job...she's so great at playing the obnoxious role of Carol. The other actors of the film did great in their roles as well, and I can't think of anyone who would have played them better. This movie is not just a drama...it's a drama, comedy, and suspense film. The film is never boring, and for days afterward I was still thinking about parts of the movie, and I still have discussions about it with my friends. It's such a thought provoking movie."

The use of actual props and NASA footage made this movie a real look into history. I think the intent was to inform you more than entertain you, and this movie did bolth. To say this movie was boring, three guys floating around in a broken tin can shows the lack of inteligence in that particular viewer. The story of Apollo 13 is true, it happened, it is an important date in areospace history and this movie portraies it well '

Kids just love seeing the idea of a 10-year-old outsmarting two criminal bandits. The physical abuse they endure at the hands of Kevin McCallister is the extremely humorous part. Also, everyone has been angry at their family and felt left out at one point or another; but it teaches that you have to look past that and be with your family (especially during the holiday season)."

S"Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie. The story of John Nash, in itself, is fascinating. But Russell Crowe's protrayal is a stellar piece of acting. Crowe would have gotten his second straight Oscar for that role, had it not been for an episode of behaving badly to a film exec just before the Oscars. Jennifer Connelly is goddess-like in this film. Her Oscar is well deserved. Scott Glenn, as always, excels. The movie depicts the horrors of going through life as a paranoid schizophrenic. Nash's eventual triumph is overwhelmingly emotional. My favorite parts of the movie is when Nash is cogent and lucid. He was a genius of the highest magnitude. The way the movie demonstrated his Nobel Prize winning theory of economic equilibrium (using the example of picking up women at bars) was one of the neatest things I've seen in the movies."

Based on the book by Fannie Flagg, this heart-warming story tells a tale of a forbidden love, murder, compassion, caring and redempion in the South during the early part of the 20th century. Told in narrative by an elderly nursing home resident (played brillianty by Jessica Tandy (but, then again, have you ever seen her act anything but brilliantly?)), the story not only gives you hope, but you can actually see it caried out on the screen by Kathy Bates (also in a brilliant role!) as she listens and befriends the elderly lady.

Forrester has the same gritty style of movie-making (and a great Miles Davis-dominated soundtrack), but this time it's wrapped around an uplifting story of a supremely gifted black teenager and his discovery as a legendary mentor. Sure, the story is quite improbable and it glosses over A LOT... but Connery and Rob Brown are both excellent, so you wind up WANTING to forgive the plot lapses and hoping for the predictable ending. In a weak year for movies, I left this one thinking it was worth the trip."

S"Predictably when you consider the subject matter, Hotel Rwanda is not a particularly uplifting movie. But it is an excellent one. Without giving anything away, Hotel Rwanda is the true story of a Hutu hotel manager of a four star hotel in Kigali who converted the hotel at which he worked into a refugee camp for Hutus and Tutsis during the 1994 massacre (mostly by machete) that slaughtered about 1M civilians. It's an extremely educational film - for example, I didn't know that the Hutu and Tutu designation had been arbitrarily assigned by the Belgian colonialists based on completely subjective physical attributes (e.g. you're pretty tall, you shall be a tutsi). The movie does a really good job of showing that Kigali is a civilized, modern city - and the massacre that took place was not between two bloodthirsty tribes in the desert somewhere. But most of all, Hotel Rwanda illustrates with chilling, powerful simplicity what can happen with out of control partisanship, combined with hate radio, combined with animosity. My wife cried pretty much entirely through this movie, and parts of it are hard to handle. But it's worth seeing, if nothing else for the education, and to see the brilliant performance of Don Cheadle."

S"It's kind of amazing that two of the best movies of the last 15 years or so are novellas by Stephen King, a man more well known for horror books (Stand By Me is the other movie). Shawshank is brilliantly written and produced. Tim Robbins is at the top of his game, but it is the performance by Morgan Freeman which is the most impressive. He is simply wonderful. Due to the number of times that this film has been on TNT/TBS, I have probably seen it 15 or so times and it has never gotten old. I can't recommend a movie more highly than Shawshank."

All people need to feel significant, however, some do it positively and some do it negatively. With a twist of irony, the end of Taxi Driver makes it clear that society is very distorted. They make this deranged taxi driver a hero, without knowing who he really is. We must be careful in choosing who to glorify."

Not only was the plot interesting but the settings were very beautiful and the music was spectacular. Whether you enjoy classical music or not surely you can appreciate the effort that was put into this film. The amount of practice that went into composing and performing these pieces is incredible and you can tell it in the actors and actresses appearance on the set. It is a sweet love story filled with much passion. GREAT TALENT - I kid you not, these people can actually sing unlike a lot of people in today's society. "

While I would have loved to see a little more inbetween time, I loved the movie and was on the edge of my seat for the crash scene.

Freeman is a one of the greatest actors ever and this is one of his best pictures. I have the DVD and find myself watching it a couple of times a year just for inspiration."

I personally advise that non-WWII veterans see this movie, because possibly the acting and the backgrounds are so realistic that it could cause recurring bad or even traumatic memories to the viewer, and trigger unwanted emotions from that time in their lives that could send them into tears or fear. One good side is that it does a good job in showing just how incredibly influential WWII was, and it gives the viewer a good idea of the struggles, both military and personal. We, as Americans had to endure and win what could have been history's ultimate battle between good and evil."

I'm not exactly fond of movies with violence or profanity, but I feel that this is a rare exception . The direction of Schindler's List is superb. I couldn't believe how a movie that starts with such disturbing scenes and ideas could end on such a strong positive side. I had forgotten all about the violence inflicted on the prisoners, and, instead, I contemplated the strong example shown by Oskar Schindler in this fantastic true story. I recommend this movie to everyone mature enough to handle the extreme elements, and to see it again when you have forgotten the valor and courage shown by Schindler in this film."

S"Easily the best American film of 2000, Curtis Hansen's edition of Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys stands out as a classic of modern cinema, with its exotic characters and its absurd story structure. It's innumerable amounts of fun, certainly moreso than the average film of any genre, including fluffy fun movies in the comdy and action genres. A great script, spectacularly acted. The cinematography is superb... The film, for all its absurdity, is rather solid. A masterpiece."

S'Quinten Tarantino has a way to create a story, make it go backwards, than flip it upside-down, and make you want to rant and rave about it for the rest of your existance. Out of the few movies he has made this is my favorite. And I will strike down with great vengenance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengance apon thee. -Pulp Fiction '

Yes, the real EB dresses like a whore. Not the way Julia Roberts dressed in the movie, but 10 times more revealing and she's open about it. Yes, the real EB has a gutter mouth. That's the way she talks and she's open about it. And when you're talking about this movie, don't forget the marvelous job that Albert Finney did as the crotchety Ed Masry. Unless you're predisposed to hate Julia Roberts, it's a must see."

S"David Fincher always manages to direct the kind of films that take the viewer to the deepest, darkest recesses of the psyche and have them relate to it consciously or subconciously. Fight Club is a fine example of this! And Fincher's presentation of the film proves that as his skill is improving, his cynacism and originality remain intact. (The IKEA scene was much lauded and I know will be much emulated in the future.) The script in this film blew me away with it's colorful narration and crisp dialogue. The acting in this film was phenomenal. It wasn't so much Edward Norton that surprised me as what I've seen of his talent he could play the transvestite in The Crying Game and have us all completely fooled, nor was it Brad Pitt who by the way hasn't exuded so much personality in a film since 12 Monkeys . It was Helena Bonham Carter who fleshed out Marla so beautifully that it was difficult to sympathize with her, yet it was impossible to hate her as well. And Meatloaf, who was completely surprising, was so touching and funny in his portrayal of Bob. But let's talk about the violence in this movie. I'm going to have to agree with Ploughman on this one: the violence in Fight Club is as signifigant as it was in A Clockwork Orange and should not be missed. Watching a film with the word Fight in the title and not expecting violence is like watching Faces of Death and not expecting to be traumatized! But the fight scenes are not only representative of Norton's inner turmoil (as Ploughman pointed out so insightfully), but an example of the lengths we go to to feel more alive, more complete in a society where we are becoming merely human counterparts to the technology we create. With that, if you haven't seen this film, watch it, and let the fight scenes make an imprint in your mind. What I find disturbing is not this film, but that the Academy chooses to recognize three-hour long drivel like Titanic and The English Patient and almost completely ignores brilliant, insightful explorations into the human condition like Fight Club !"

S"This has got to be one of the best war movies of all time. It beats out The Patriot by a long shot. This film had all the goods nad presented a realistic re-enactment of the rise and fall of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment led by Col. Robert Gould Shaw. As a lover of history, I knew that I had to see this movie when I first heard about it, and I was not disappointed. The characters were all perfectly developed, and the buildup to the climax was phenominal. Not to mention the wonderful acting by the all-star cast which included Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, Jay O'Sanders and others. I enjoyed seeing each of the characters evlve in their own way: espescially that of Denzel Washington, whose character was so cynical, hateful and spiteful at the beginning but in the end we learned his true feelings of respect for the brave men fighting beside him. Glory is a moving, inspirational film which shows that a true patriot is one who defends his country even when it had wronged him. A true patriot is one who tries to fix the wrong. And that is exactly what the men of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment helped do. A great movie!"

I have never read so much crap that makes me feel angry. Did you know that the human body has male and female hormones, so if there was an imbalance, then that person would either be more feminine or masuline. And there have been many cases of where the person should have been born as the other sex. There are many people in this world who succeed dressing up as the opposite sex and getting away with it. Surely you watch the Jerry Springer Show - you get lots of cases of where a man decides to be a woman and has a boyfriend - and he doesn't know. In Japan, there are men who transform themselves into women who look very realistic. My sister gets mistaken for a young boy. So you were saying..... "

Particularly impressive to me were the performances by Benicio del Toro as the Mexican cop and the girl who played Michael Douglass' daughter.

And republicans are very dense and stubborn - their vote is more about beating liberals than it is the betterment of the country. No facts or propaganda could change their mind. They don't care if Bush is a liar. So, who cares? Good movie.)))))))) ))))))))UPDATE. And they KNOW Bush is a liar. They don't care, people. It's like Ben Affleck's sister saying 'Gigli' was good. She knows it sucked, but she'll be damned if she is going to givwe critics the pleasure. Deep down they all know he is the worst president in history. They go to bed thinking about it. But if you say it to them, they will defend him at all cost. Come on, even republicans are not that stupid. They know. It's so obvious. ALL THE LIVING GREAT MINDS AGREE. I think it's a shame that folks voted for Bush, thus throwing our country away, basically, literally for spite. Damn shame. We will fall, just like Rome, and historians in the future will look upon this administration's run as the turning point. Naturally, republicans will dismiss this comment, like the stubborn morons they are. That's the problem - nobody will open their minds. THINK PEOPLE! Trust me, THAT is what Jesus wants.)))))))))))))))))UPDATE Being against the war is the most support one can give the troops. If I was there, I would feel more supported by the people who wanted me to come home and NOT DIE. I would feel less supported by the people on the right, and the administration that said, casualties are irrelevant right now. "

While the movie got off to a slow start, and during the first 15 minutes was left to wonder what exactly the hype was all about, when the movie actually got started and my question was answered. It's friggin' hillarious. Vince Vaughn is a hero of mine (I'll forgive him the misfortune that was Be Cool) and this movie made him even more so in my eyes. His facial expressions were nothing short of priceless, and he delivers his lines with such vigor that it looks as though this is the most fun he's had on a set in a long time. Owen Wilson was wonderful as well, playing his typical player-but-nice-guy-at-the-same-time role which was perfect for the movie. It is rude, unappologetic, and had both the audiences I was in today in an uproar of laughter. This movie will be promptly added to my movie collection once out on DVD. It's Wedding Season!"

Although the movies subject matter of divorce is depressing Robert Benton and Avery Corman manage to find a balance with the screenplay and novel as to why the mother walked out on her son and how the father manages to cope as a single parent. What I loved about Meryl's performance as Joanna Kramer is that she un-doubtedly did something wrong, but funnily enough I sympathised with her character succumbing to her role as a young mother and wife. Dustin Hoffman was brilliant as Ted Kramer and a very young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer was a complete natural. This film managed to encompass a complicated and somewhat delicate issue of its time."

S"I think this is a great movie . I have seen this so many times I know it word for word through the whole movie and I can do the fast-talking sequence ( what you wouldn't read about is how ray finkle lost his mind was committed to a mental hospital only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hiker manipulating his way to the top in a diabolical scheme to get even with Dan Marino who he blamed for the entire thing ) faster than Jim Carrey in the movie and yet I still laugh at the jokes. My favourite part is when Ace turns up at Ray Finkles house and says hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle then a shotgun is pointed to is head. He replies and a clean pair of shorts . And when asked over the phone by Courtney Cox where he is , he says I'm in Phsychoville and Finkle's the Mayor . All in all one of Carreys best performances. The sequel was crap."

More obscure references [to that decade] than a 5-hour Dennis Miller rant; 3) Best Musical Soundtrack ever; 4) Best Girlpower Flick ever (My, my, how Uma has evolved since playing the helpless femme in Dangerous Liaisons); 5) While I think Tarantino is an outright jackass ( particularly by giving fathead turncoat Moore the Palm D'Or), you must marvel at his masterful directorial skills and cinematography; 6) Most violent film I ever saw (though most of the bloodshed is in the Roadrunner vs. Wile E.

S'A History of Violence is an examination of the grip and depth of human violence. The portrayal of violence is not artistic like Natural Born Killers, nor deglorified overchoreographed thrill like scenes from Mr. instead, it is raw, realistic, graphic and necessary. If sex, nudity and violence are either temptations or offenses to you, don\'t see this movie. Performances and screenplay A+, the technical part not as good, especially the nudity and sex scenes, which were few, necessary in concept, but mechanical in portrayal. (I felt as if someone was saying, "freeze, need to capture this pubic hair," or "shift, need another butt shot.") This movie has no tidy wrap-up ending, is not an upper nor a downer, just reality. It biblically portrays both the miserable condition/need of man and man\'s sublime possibilities, and exposes the futility of man\'s contrivances for escaping/avoiding evil (pain, chaos, unhappiness) while subtly pointing to the only true Way of deliverance.'

This is a great action movie which catipulted Willis from television to the big screen. While parts follow the simple action movie formula (superhero fighting evil), the movie has a good sub-plot surrounding the scumbag television reporter.

S"Have given this movie a five because it gives you what you want - a funny, engaging, film that leaves you satisfied that you paid your money to watch. With some movies you are waiting for the laughs to materialise but this film has a high quota, both visual and in the dialogue and some clever editing/storytelling to keep the plot moving apace. In this film you start off liking the characters and by the end you are rooting for them in all their travails in life, be it retrieving the sex video or getting laid. There are some funny subplots too such as Tom Green's attempt to feed the snake and the girl's trip to Boston instead of Austin. The writers have used the premise of If we could do anything we wanted and get away with it what would we do? and so we see the theft of a Blind School's bus, an all-black fraternity house, masturbation, and car jumping. It's all good fun and so I would recommend to watch this film....although not with your parents!"

Canadian youth learn about the massacre briefly, too briefly actually, because of Canadian involvement in peacekeeping there. However, I don't know how much young Americans are taught on the subject, and I think that this movie is the best source to get the point across. Not a lot of people saw it, I know it won't win the Oscar for Best Picture, but I wish it would. Not for pretigue, but for recognition, so that more people will go and see it. I haven't seen any of the other movies up for the award (don't really know WHAT movies are up for the award), but I can honestly say that this in one of the best movies I have seen in a while. One of the few movies I don't mind paying 10+ bucks to see in the theater. The only thing I found wrong was Nick Nolte and ambush scene. I felt it was too action-hero like."

S"Besides the fact that Pulp Fiction had all the elements of a great movie done by an brilliant writer/director, it served also a gateway to a lot of people. It proved to so many that a film doesn't require a lot of money to be truly a piece of cinematic art and indie films were finally getting the attention they deserved. It inspired a host of Tarantino imitators to create colorful, violent crime films from the sublime ( The Usual Suspects ) to the mere forgettable ( Truth or Consequences,NM ). But what is so amazing about this film (and hasn't even been touched on in this slew of reviews) is that with Tarantino, nothing is sacred and everything is fair game! Accidental murder results in name calling and a hilarious aftermath, sodomy/rape results in a comical bit where Butch can't make up his mind which weapon to save his enemy with, racial slurs are used repeatedly by a white guy who, consequently, is married to an African American woman, and Jules (who breaks a major commandment for a living) recites word for word a quote from the Holy Bible. This film has shined a light on the most taboo of subjects and made us not only stare in wonder, but made us take notice of the one film that mirriors society's own irreverence!"
