S"My advice - do not rent, buy or even waste your time watching this thing with friends. Unless, of course, you're in the mood to make fun of something that will barely challenge your skills in sarcasm. It is by far the most inane but successful waste of celluloid I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. As much as I hate to admit it, I bought a $6.00 bargain copy - suckered in by my own curiosity and the cagey promotional stunt as seen on the Sci-Fi channel. Sci-Fi's promotional documentary , while very shrewd and effective, was still basically a big fat lie. Still, it was more cleverly done and coherently put together than the actual film. I completely agree with Molfan - 90 minutes of your life you will never get back."

S"HORRIBLE! This was the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Who were the idiots who came up with the story for this one? The characters are so weak, nobody can possibly give a damn about them. The so-called plot is horrible, the setting never changes, and there is only one action scene in the whole movie. I would've fallen asleep if I didn't have some booty next to me. Keanu or whatever his name is absolutely sucks. No skills. No talent. And what's up with movies nowadays being either too short or too damn long. When I go to the movies, I want to see a solid two-hour movie that doesn't waste my time. This movie is about an hour and a half and I honestly would've been happier throwing up on myself and wiping it up with my hands. If a movie even remotely similar to this ever comes out again, somebody in Hollywood is gonna catch a beat down."

S"Simply put, Bowling for Columbine is a disaster of a movie. I thought it would be at least somewhat thought-provoking, and instead I found it disjointed, uninspiring, and too slanted to be taken seriously. The movie jumped around from one issue to another with such a heavy hand that it seemed like a joke (and perhaps it was). Michael Moore's interactions along the way were extremely annoying, and I kept asking myself why he didn't ask more intelligent questions. He certainly had some interesting ideas to work with. To top it off, the movie seemed to go on forever. When I see how much acclaim this movie received, I'm baffled. Perhaps it's the Emperor's-New-Clothes phenomenon..."

First jeepers creepers and now this! Why did they have to kill the guy? He was the only cool guy in the movie. That's totally not how I would end a movie. And I just wanna say that the part of the reason why the movie scared me so f***ing much is that it was so nasty! I mean the dead bodies didn't have to be so ugly... And BIGBABY is right, too many unanswered questions. I think the horrors should be scary while you watch them and the ending is supposed to rid the viewer of all fear, because everything is supposed to be explained. My butt! And considering that the movie was actually a rip-off of that other japanese movie, its identical copy one might say, the director has done a poor job. Message to the directors: please, don't make so f***ing scary senseless movies!"

Even Christopher Lee couldn't deliver the join the dark side speech in a way that didn't sound exactly like the first one from Vader. The crowning achievement in this horrible travesty of a film was Skywalker Sr. goes to rescue his mother. I literally was crying with laughter when she looked up into her son's eyes, just barely holding onto life, and says Ani? Is that you? Oh, you're so handsome. What is this? A visit to Grandma's? Just a perfectly awful film. The only parts I enjoyed were the parts when there was no dialogue to ruin it."

S'What an utter disappointment, there is no comparison between this tripe and the original (which is a remake of the superior Japanese version). The original had genuine atmosphere, inventive cinematography and real suspense. The film quality is very standard this time around and lacks the high contrast grainy quality of the first that added to the atmosphere. The main protagonist hasn\'t gained any more intelligence since the first movie. In fact, she is a complete ditz who needs an IQ infusion to take it out of the double digits. In the first version, she had somewhat of an excuse as she stumbled across the origins of the videotape and began to realize the implications. There were indications in the first movie that she was somewhat of an absent parent who needed to make a connection with her child. In this version, she is even more absent-minded and neglectful. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD Examples: 1) Right near the beginning, the demonic girl makes an appearance by emerging from a body bag and grabbing the mother to try to pull her into the netherworld. Hmmm...you\'d think the mother would clue in and grab her kid and find a police station, hospital or some of other well-lit public place with lots of other people. Nope, instead she leaves her kid alone in a big empty house while she does her investigative reporting at all hours of the night. Plus, they have a Big Screen TV in their new digs. Hello! You would think after what they went through in the first movie, they would avoid being around TVs at all costs. It gets worse, not even half way through the movie, the mother has either left her kid alone or lost him altogether an additional 2-3 times. Example 2) would be after seeing the demonic girl manifest herself in the kid\'s room and seep out of the walls, the mother takes her son to her romantic interest\'s house...and leaves him alone in the bathtub while she goes for a drive! The demonic girl loves the water; it\'s her calling card and main mode of transport, apparently. So, naturally the kid is on his own again with you-know-who. And don\'t get me started on the "scary" computer-animated herd of roaming deer, yeah, that\'s right --- demonic deer! Vicious, villainous venison! Oooo, spooky! It has to be one of the most unintentionally funny moments in a horror film and brings the suspense to a screeching halt. No floatation device, ring or otherwise, would save this sinker. '

Over 20 profanities are present in this film, with the f-word, AGAIN, being the most frequently-used one. Filmakers, please listen, profanity is NOT neccessary to make a film!!!! As you would expect from a (so-called) movie about Gigolos, sexual content runs rampant, with graphic descriptions of everything from masturbation to genitals present. And, of course, alcohol and drugs are present. But, I tell you one thing, that isn't present: a good actor!

Considering that it was brought forth by Annette Bening, Michael Douglas and Rob Reiner, the viewer really cannot expect anything less, and yet again is forced to listen to the pontifications of Bening and Douglas with regard to their political views. I must say that I am quite sick of meathead trying to tell me how to run my life, he should stick to simpler and relatively non-effrontery comedy without political motivations.

S'I have never been so bored in all my life. All talent used in this movie was wasted. The plot was lacking, the idea itself was lacking, all the characters lacked. This movie never gets off the ground. It seems to sit on its keyster and through out sperattic action hostage flick cliches. But, they are clever when they do this. By boring you to tears a little explosion or a motorist getting blown to bits by machine gun fire is a welcome happening even though it adds nothing to the film. My advice STAY FAR FAR AWAY.'

S"I can see why Goldmember was panned by the critics. It's a really, really bad movie. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but it didn't even come close to making my trip to the theater worth it. My biggest complaint was that it contained very little new material. Even worse, the old material was stale and even pathetic in places. The plot revolving around Goldmember was uninteresting, and Goldmember was a disgusting old guy who ate patches of dead skin that peeled off his body. (I'm not kidding!) Mike Meyers' acting seemed forced and choppy, and there was no chemistry between him and Foxxy Cleopatra, his female helper. Goldmember lacked the fun, silly feel of the second Austin Powers movie, and the pace was slow. I don't recommend seeing this movie in the theater or on video."

This plays like an overlong episode of the series, and indeed, essentially rips off some of the same plots from The Next Gen series. All the attempts at humor are flat, stupid, and downright embarrassing, and all the regulars seem ashamed to be in this movie. There are some good parts here and there, but as a whole, it desperately needed a lot of work."

It takes place on a boat and than there in manhatten at the last 15 mins of the movie. -8 mins in the sewers. Then,the deaths.The death scenes were weak.There's a coal/rock death,gkass slashing,and the boxing death being one of the goofiest deaths ever.Than last,there's the awful acting.Horrible,like in most of the F13 movies but in this,they don't even attempt to act,even the lead character.And is that ugly little kid that haunts the girl actually scary?

(I walked out of the theater during Nurse Betty. ) Anyway, I like Steve Martin, and I thought Novocaine looked like an enjoyable dark comedy. I have three major complaints about the show. First, the plot got off to a pretty good start, but it never went anywhere. In addition, the actions of Steve Martin's character were totally unbelievable, in my opinion, and I found myself grumbling about that to my husband throughout the show. Finally, the movie is pretty disturbing, and I have pictures in my mind I'd rather not have, as a result. Don't even think about wasting your time on this one."

S"Up until this movie, Harrison Ford had the most spotless list of good movies that any actor would only dream of having. Some would say that this movie may have started a chain of lacklustre movies. With later titles such as What Lies Beneath and Hollywood Homicide, that may be true. The biggest problem wth this movie, and the main reason why it's so bad, is the concept of the movie. Two different people meet up with one another because the strange simultanious deaths of their lovers. That's it! There is no real plotline to follow up on. The audience is left with no real resolution. You might as well say the movie ends 30 minutes into it. With that in mind, anyone watching will be left in a state of bordem that drains the life out of them the reminder of the time. Do yurelf a favor, and pass this one up. Pick up the Sabrina remake before this one."

S'It is hard for me to give this film a very high rating.As great a cast it has and as wonderful as the performances may be, it lacks any positive or happy moments. There is not one redeming quality about the feeling you get from this picture. Do you like to watch family and loved ones go through complete anguish and misery? Every up turn in this movie does a complete and horrible down swing towards an unimaginable worse. From brothers watching their brothers die, to husbands watching their wives get shot, this is without a doubt the most pointlessly depressing movie ever made. What do you get from it? I walked out of it when I saw it in sixth grade. I tried to watch it a year ago in my Junior year in high school and found it almost as unbearable. The cast and crew do a wonderful job at creating this beautiful looking nightmare worse than any horror film I have ever seen. This movie has no message except that life sucks, there is little good in the world, and in the end after nothing but sh*t happens to you your entire life, a bear will eat you and people will say it was a good way to go. What a pointless and negative message.'

If this is the way our military system operates I'LL reinlist tommorow. Now I know that Hollywood Takes libertys with the facts but this movie went way out of hand.If your going to make a movie about Pearl Habor then do so, show us the facts and the unknowns of the day.

S"This is just about the worst Bond movie ever. To say the plot is flimsy would be to grossly overstate the existence of a plot. The casting belongs on the TV, or a Channel 4 low budget film - Robert Carlyle as a Bond bad guy? I don't think so - Robbie Coltrane and Goldie (??????) - nuff said. Only Judi Dench has the screen quality, but she comes across like your headmistress from school, not your boss. Bonds got worse when Harry Saltzman left (died?), worse still when they ran out of books to base the plots on, and have hit an absolute nadir now Cubby Broccoli isn't involved. Give up - Not another - This was a shameful exploitation to hide the lack of a plot by having an action sequence ever five minutes. And I just can't suspend disbelief any longer - Bond films started in the 1962, which assuming he was around 30 then makes him about 70 by now. They also belong in that era, when the Cold War threat actually did exist, and films such as From Russia, Goldfinger etc had some degree of plausibility. Loons like Carlyle, Jonathan Pryce and Sean Bean just do not have any credibility in the modern, post Glasnost era. "

The characters are only self interested and shallow while the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seemed like it's only purpose was to mess up that little love triangle between the only three characters in the movie. What a bunch of saps."

S'I do not know what led me to believe this would be a comedy but I was truly disappointed when I quickly found that it wasn t. I was further disappointed that the entire story was depressing, pointless and had an ugly edginess to it. Drew Barrymore did not convince me that she was this woman at the age of 15, 36 or anything in between. She further failed to convince me that her character was deserving of my sympathy or respect. Half the time I wanted to slap some sense into her and the other half I simply lost interest in her self-involved mindset. She set herself up, she fell and then she proceeded to whine and blame everyone around her. I kept wanting to say if you re as smart as you think you are and if college and career are so important to you then get off your butt, get a part-time job, a student loan and go for it you know, join the rest of the real world. Were we really supposed to feel sorry for this self-interested idiot who ignores her child and proceeds to dry pot in the oven of her government subsidized shack for some quick cash? Apparently no more than we were meant to enjoy this dreadful tale of woe.'

S"I hate saying it, but not even Snoop Dogg and is great personality could save this sad, sorry, tired piece of trash. So fast paced it's rushed, so poorly written it reads like a Dick and Jane book. Characters so thin they are translucent. Blood so orange it looks like buffalo wing sauce. You cannot help but not feel for any character in this film they are so run of the cheese mill. Snoop is fun to watch but gave a much better performance in the recent film, Training Day, which showcased a more talented side. This is just Snoop having fun with the little he is givin. Jimmy Bones comes back seeking vengence against those who betrayed him years past. He comes back and kills them all in fifteen, maybe twenty minutes. No build up. No suspence. No one cares. He then wants to continue lovin his girl played by Pam Grier and start a relationship with his daughter of which he never had a chance to meet because he got killed. Lame as hell and just plain bad, Bones should crawl up and be put back in it's grave. Poor ol, Snoop."

S"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.... waiting for something to happen. It never did. The dialog consisted mostly of the F word, used once every 10.44 seconds. I learned that, even I could be offended by this language when exposed to it long enough. Basically, if you take 11 seconds out of the center of the movie and put it in a continuous play loop, you've got the whole thing. Stupid dialog about 3 stupid people who go into the woods with a map they can't read and a compass they don't know how to use. They have no survival skills whatsoever. Any ordinary person threatened by a 'whatever-it-was' would hopefully sharpen a couple branches and make a spear or dagger, or fashion some kind of weapon. And what's up with all the filming while they're 'running for their lives'? I don't mean to pick on the lack of realism because this is fiction, but these people were so moronic that I was actually cheering for the 'whatever-it-was' to get them so they couldn't eventually reproduce. I understand what this movie was trying to accomplish; fear of the unknown. It missed the mark by a mile. It could have worked, but it didn't. It was boring, repetitive, had dialog consisting almost entirely of F--- and left me with a burning desire to call my Congressman and demand more funding for education. I hope the $30,000 cost for this movie was spent on expensive lunches. Otherwise, it was wasted. "

Obviously those minorities only want to hold people ransom and attack the oil project so they can protect their cocaine crop.

It's hard to make a movie about a historical event and make it not predicable, but we all know that in the end the ship sinks. Also, if you watched the previews, you already knew everything that happens. Very disappointing, long and boring movie. I fell asleep during it."

S"This movie was so bad, even I can't believe it. The movie was designed to throw every possible exciting event at you, one after another, until you are thrilled out of your pants. Instead it was just overkill. I like fantasy as much as the next person but this was so fake and silly I just felt insulted instead. I don't know the first thing about mountain climbing. Or bombs. Or helicopters. But I am intelligent enough to know that 1) there's no way even a billionaire could get that many people to show up at a party on K2. Where did all the cute chicks come from? Give me a break. And all the mountain climbers partying and drinking beer? Why aren't they resting for tomorrow's hike? Puh-leeze. 2) There's no way that the Pakistani government would have allowed a team of renegade rescuers to tote leaky cartridges of explosives up some mountain. Also, if you are going to blow someone out of a hole in the mountain you had better get a crack team of precision experts to do it, rather than just sending down a note saying BANG warning the people to get down. There's no way they would have survived that blast. And 3) I don't see how that helicopter could have hovered that long to allow the rescue group to jump off without crashing. That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as the ludicrosity of this movie goes. Anyone who rated this movie above a 2 should be ashamed. The producers and directors AND ACTORS (Chris O'Donnell, I thought higher of you than this!) should be ashamed. And the movie studios that keep putting out garbage like this should be ashamed. Yes, I want action and drama, but please give me some action that makes at least a little sense. Please don't insult my intelligence like this. And give me a hero that I can believe in rather than some washed-up, guilt-ridden dude who is a carbon copy of every other action movie I have ever seen (gee, I bet the writers of this movie watched Cliffhanger while they were thinking of ideas for a hero! It's the same freakin' story!) I ended up having to buy my boyfriend dinner because I dragged him to this lousy movie. He was mad at me for at least an hour after the movie was over. Next time he gets to pick what we see. "

This film misses every beat and fails at even being a movie worth pissing on. If anything I laughed myself silly whenever Dracula himself showed up. He reminded me of Neo from the Matric. Does every actor have to over and under act? There is no middle ground acting wise in this film. This movie only succeeding in taking my money. Now I am a messanger.

Too many people have sacrificed everything to make available the freedoms we enjoy today. The forces at work to take them away from us must be stopped in their tracks. As far as historical accuracy, read about the Battle of Cowpens. You will find that the historic Battle of Cowpens was a much more one sided victory for the Continentals than the movie suggests! '

It is filmed beautifully and along with the highly emotional scenes, it also has a few funny moments (e.g. learning the white and black dislikes and likes in pairs). The DVD also has features explaining the meanings of certain scenes and an orray of deleted scenes. This is a truely beautifully told true story and teaches us to look beyond colour into the brave and wise words of Herman Boone."

S"This is my favorite Romantic Comedy of all time-no one of my favorite movies of all time. It's defiently Cameron Crowe's best. It's about a guy named Lloyd (John Cusack, who is absolutely wonderful in everyway.) who falls for rich daddy's girl Ione Skye (who's name in the movie seems to escape me at the moment, which is rather embarrasing considering I was just sprouting it's praises. Oh well..Diane? Is that it? Dammit!) Anyway, It's a beautiful story about first love, heartbreak, loss of innocense, trust,-so many different elements. And it has one of the most romantic scenes ever to be put in a movie ever. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about-when Lloyd holds up the radio playing 'In Your Eyes'(My favorite song.) to girl--who's-name-I-can't-remember-dammit!-. I have this big poster on my ceiling of that scene, with the lyrics of that song..I like to look up at it before I go to sleep(corny, i know. shut up.) It gives me hope that my john cusack is out there somewhere, boom box in hand, ready to sweep me away. Too, the emotion shown when they broke up was, well, empathistic (which isn't a word,I know.) and heartbreaking at the same time. I very highly recommend this movie. See it with someone you care about. And because Rateitall refuses to put up it's soundrack, I will say that it too is very good, and, again, highly recommended (look for a live version of Depeche Mode's 'Stripped'.) "

The movie was sweet without being saccharine, and it was filled with funny scenes. Hugh Grant, an actor I usually avoid, was outstanding in his role. In fact, he and Nicholas Hoult (who played the young boy) made the movie. If you're in the mood for a nice story, some good humor, and excellent acting, check out About a Boy. "

I adore the Oompa Loompas (all played by the same actor) and how they pop up in different settings and costumes throughout. Their musical numbers are funny and over-the-top, especially the Esther-Williams takeoff and the heavy metal band. Freddie Highmore is a perfect choice to play Charlie Bucket, full of wide-eyed innocence and grace, a perfect foil for the charicatured kids that embody a variety of social and moral ills. Director Tim Burton is a master of creepy/cartoony scenery and this film is one of his best ever. "

S"Very good film. I had been anticipating this picture heavily ever since I had fallen in love with Thora Birch in American Beauty. I was not dissapointed with this movie which is based off a sorely under appriciated graphic novel of the same title. This movie takes place following the graduation of two teenage girls who have always planned on moving in together and being forever friends. Their pleasure is scrutinizing and making fun of strangers. One day they are reading the personals and come across one that a man has placed seeking a woman he met on a plane ride. The two girls find this utterly pathetic and deside to call him, pretending to be the woman, set a date, and then go watch him as the date never shows up. Thora's character then becomes curious about the man (Steve Buscimi) and slowly grows attached as her best friend slowly grows away from her. Thora is in top form in this bitter comedy. She has mastered the bitter girl and I can't wait to see her in her next film.Simplistic in form and mature in subject. VERY good movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."

S" Fried Green Tomatoes, the quintessential chick flick, is a fantastic movie. The show alternates between two stories of women's friendship- one taking place in the present and the other set 50 years earlier in the small southern town of Whistle Stop. Kathy Bates (as a dowdy, unenlightened housewife) and Jessica Tandy (playing an octogenarian living in a nursing home) are a great pair, and they deserve credit for most of the movie's humor. The more serious side is shown through the relationship between Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) who deal with a string of serious problems at a time when women didn't have many options. The acting is outstanding across the board, and the two storylines are engrossing. Even if you aren't a chick, I recommend checking out this movie."

S'I was reading through some of the comments below and they said things along the lines of "Oh this was a terrible movie because it was just Michael Moore\'s opinion and it is wrong and he lied." News flash: It is SUPPOSED to be Michael Moore\'s opinion. Which is why he made the movie. As much as you say that he lied and presented biased information, it is just balancing out for the media which is in my opinion, more biased than Moore. I turn on Fox news for a good laugh. And about the part of him comparing deaths by gunfire in the US to other countries, maybe it would have been more afective if he had done it in percentage to population, but if you havn\'t already figured it out. 11,000 something deaths in the US is a higher percentage than 20 something in Japan. In this documentary he presented excellent points, and I agreed with him on most of what he said. Not only that but it was a nice movie to watch, at times it was incredibly funny, and others were very emotional. And if he made millions off the movie, it\'s because people liked it. '

S'I can understand that some people would find the deliberate, methodical pace of this film as off-putting, but I think if you take it in the context of the social and class relationships of that time, you glean a new understanding of the film. To me, it is amazing the amount of restraint that Hopkins and Thompson bring to their roles, as would only be proper for those in service at the time. The juxtaposition of the unattainable romance of two downstairs people against the fading glory of the upstairs crowd is genius. Especially interesting is the fact that the author, who so manages to capture the essence of the English class structure, is an expatriate Japanese.'

S"If one film could incapsulate the self-indulgence of the eighties onto a single piece of celluloid, it would be this one. Al Pacino plays arguably the greatest role of his prestigious career in his performance of Tony Montana, an ironic personification of the American dream. Tony is a lowly career criminal who comes to America from Communist Cuba with little more than the shirt on his back and a gleam in his eye. Fueled by his newly liberated sense of desire, he goes from rags to riches (dealing in yayo, naturally). In doing so though, he becomes lax, decadent and obsessed with money. This action packed tale is a vividly painted portrait of the double-edged sword that is desire. The plentiful action scenes are inventive and Pacino lends a infectious intensity to them. Oh yes, it's funny too. Pacino's portrayal of the exaggeratedly crude Montana is side-splitting as he spouts language that would make Howard Stern wince. Scarface is the complete package, a true epic and every minute is infused with vibrant creativity."

S" Far From Heaven uses superb craftmanship to make this film look and feel like a film from the 1950s. It plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before. One detail is particularly true to the time: interracial love and homosexual love are treated as being on different moral planes. Contemporary movies take so many subjects for granted that they never really look at them. Director Todd Haynes, by stepping back in time is able to bring these issues into focus. Cinematographer, Ed Lachman faithfully reproduces the lush 1950s studio style and every shot has the studied artiface of 1950s set decoration . The musical score, by Elmer Bernstein, is true to the time, with its underlining points and its punching-up emotions.I don't wish to give a synopsis of the movie's scenes except to say it is packed with power, incredible acting, and images that hit home. I had to find it showing in an art theatre as it never made major marquees. Catch if you can!!"

The movie comes from the book by Hubert Selby, Jr. Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn give exceptional performances. This was as uncomfortable as I have been while watching a movie since seeing A Panic In Needle Park. It was so powerful that I didn't realize I had seen a great motion picture until much later in the evening. One of those films that makes you feel like you need a shower immediately after viewing."

S"A very intense, chilling movie that exploits the racial issues that still exist far and throughout this great country of ours. As usual, Edward Norton, the charismatic actor that he is, gives us a brilliant performance as a brutal skinhead who when released from prison has finally seen the error of his ways. Talk about a brilliant character transformation. I thought that Norton and his working buddy in the prison did a wonderful job together. Also a great performance by the usually-annoying Edward Furlong. It truly is a shockingly blunt film with its language and exploitation of the brutal reality of racism. Racism offends me, but I still found this to be a very good movie, and I suggest that all Americans, whether you've been able to let go of racism or not, see this film."

S"I'm so glad to see so many positive reviews for Rocky. This is my favorite boxing movie of all time. In January or February of 1976 I was a young boxer training at the Main Street Gym, in Los Angeles, California, when I got a call from my manager/trainer, Mel Epstein, telling me that they were filming a movie about the life of Rocky Marciano at the gym. He asked if I would like to be an extra in the movie. Well, of course I said yes. Well as it turns out, they were not making a Marciano Bio. As the filming got under way, I had a chance to meet Sylvester Stallone, at that time I was not very impressed, since the only other time I had ever seen him was in The Lords of Flatbush. He was not yet the superstar he would later become. Infact he was really an unknown. He was, however a very nice guy. I got a picture with him and I've since had it blown up into an 8 X 10, it's my pride and joy of a long ago time. In case anybody is interested, the scene that I'm in is when Rocky and Mickey are argueing after his gear was removed from his locker and hung on skid row. I'm in the upper right hand corner, in the ring that's on the right of the screen. I'm sparring with Monroe Brooks, who was the California State champ at the time, and a very nice guy, by the way. I'm wearing an off white or tan colored trunks and head gear. Actually these were my Navy Swim trunks. Brooks, I believe, was wearing red trunks. Not that it matters but just for identification only, he's the black guy. (I hate doing that). Burgess Meredith had lunch with Mel (my trainer) and picked his brain for his Mickey character. They filmed at the gym for three days, and I got paid forty dollars a day. I would have done it for free. I was glad to see the movie get an Oscar, and was dissapointed that Stallone did not get the best actor award. It's funny but my kids always tease me, they know I like showing the movie and the picture, whenever someone is over for the first time. I've tried to stop because I think it embaresses them. Rocky was a classic story about an underdog who gets his shot at respect. For all these reasons, Rocky is one of my favorite movies, definetly my favorite boxing movie."

I thought this movie was done in great taste, and Pee Wee seemed so naive and innocent thru out the whole Big Adventure. Like most other reviewers on this website, there are so many scenes and lines that could never be forgotten, they are so memorable. I always hoped there would be a part 2 to this particular movie, but I guess it is best to leave well enough alone in this case. Or maybe there were plans for a second one until Pee Wee had fun with the willy? Who knows? But I certainly don't think Pee Wee should be condemned for enjoying masturbation, as it is natural. But he could have kept it in the bedroom, that is for sure. And like the Bee said, he isn't the only one in Hollywood who does these kinds of things, but Pee Wee just didn't get away with it."

DO NOT listen to the critics who will tell you it's gimmicky or that it tries too hard to be post postmodern or even worse -- much much much worse -- that it unravels and falls apart at the end. These critics were not paying attention! When you're watching Adaptation you become aware that the movie seems to be alive and growing and making itself up as the film runs through the projector. Seeing the interplay between the things that happen to our hero, the things he learns and experiences, and how those things affect this script that got made into this movie that you're watching... it's thrilling. Nothing less than thrilling. All movies should be this original and entertaining and -- dare I say it -- deep! Don't skip this one. Skip Gangs of New York, but not Adaptation!"

Christopher Walken is incredible as a guy who just can't get over the horrors of his capture. And, Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep give great performances, as well. This isn't your typical Vietnam movie in that it doesn't focus so much on the war itself. Instead, you gain a great understanding of how lives were absolutely ruined even for the survivors. If you're looking for light Friday night fare, this isn't the movie for you. But if you're looking to be moved, this would be a good choice."

I love the movie itself, actors (chemistry between veteran Mel Gibson and new-comer Heath Ledger's are sooooo good), soundtrack!

S"I was lucky enough to view an advanced screening of Wedding Crashers last Thursday night. Hilarious doesn't do the film justice. You know how in most films you remember the funniest parts and bring them up as you leave the theater? This one, it's hard to remember the best parts because there's so many of them. Unlike his previous films, where Vince Vaughn is usually reduced to the role of 'scene stealer', here we get a full dose of Babaganush, and he's in his finest form since 'Swingers'. If you liked him in his Swingers/Made persona, you'll love him here. Some of the riffs that he has literally will have you holding your sides with laughter. Owen Wilson is Owen Wilson. You either like him or you don't. He's more of the straight man in this film, although he does have some pretty good lines too, and he has great chemistry with Vaughn, especially in the scenes where they're fighting. He's the ying to Vaughn's yang. The movie certainly 'earns' it's R rating. There's a healthy dose of nudity, sex related hijinks, and f-bombs. But it's not 'gross out' humor a la American Pie. It pushes boundaries, but not just in a 'shock value' way. It's genuinely funny. I saw the movie with a bunch of critics, who usually the jaded type, were laughing their asses of as well. Guys will love this movie and will be quoting it for the rest of the year. Girls will love it too though, and there is a romantic subplot (cheesy at times, but forgivable given how funny the movie is), with Rachael McAdams doing a great job as Owen Wilson's love interest. Isla Fischer plays the role of 'scene stealer' in this one, serving as Vince Vaughn's psycho love interest. And Chris Walken is Chris Walken. So overall..inappropriate, hilarious and glorious. Better than Oldschool. Way better than Anchorman. Best comedy of the year, maybe the last couple of years. "

S"5-star excellence, yet niche appeal only. Capote is a brilliant examination of the human psyche, in particular, Capote's, with themes of societal marginalization, narcissim, empathy, and the intersection/overlap of the same. This movie chronicles Capote's writing of a book about a Kansas quadruple murder, 'In Cold Blood,' a torturous yet sublime project that required years of emotional dedication during which Capote, something of an outsider himself, drew close to one of the 2 sociopaths and thru that relationship elicited the facts for the book. 'Capote' is not entertaining--there's no suspension of disbelief, escapist action or comedy, intellectual diversion of a whodunit, nor drama with a happy ending. But it is a display of crisp filmmaking--no extaneous story, no unnecessary dialogue, nor extra emotion, but quality writing and acting, for which lead actor Philip Seymour Hoffman rightly earned his Golden Globe. Consequently, this movie will appeal to those who admire movie crafts. Americana aficionados and writers, especially of the true crime genre, might also have special interest. And those who'd most appreciate 'Capote' might be those involved by profession or circumstance in getting info from sociopaths during years of drawn- out, emotionally toilsome legal process--such might find I-am-not-alone comfort in the movie.

S"Normally a fan of action movies, I was skeptical about watching Dead Poets Society. After I did, however, I found it to be an amazing movie with a great plot and many lessons to be learned. It hits close to home with alot of people on points of opression, peer pressure, and just plain being yourself. Robin Williams did a stellar job of portraying the very enthusiastic and very individual Mr. Keating, who's teachings lead a group of restless and discontented teens to reinstate the Dead Poets Society, where they read literature from the past few centuries. The lessons taught in this film are based upon the Transcendentalist views of famous writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. It urges viewers to be free from the constraints of society and from the opression of worrying what others think. This movie is perhaps the best-written and acted movie I have ever seen. If you have not yet seen this movie, I strongly urge you to do so."

Seeing the movie billed as a comedy and seeing that Steve Martin was the lead, I was expecting a light, Roxanne-like movie that might be good for a couple of laughs. What I got was the bizarre, dark little movie about a complacent dentist (Martin) who makes a couple of bad decisions, and sees his life spiral out of control. While there are funny scenes, this movie is in NO way a comedy. Think Donnie Darko, not The Jerk. There were some outstanding performances by bit parts - Scott Caan as the villain, Kevin Bacon as the movie star doing research for a murder mystery film, and of course Laura Dern. This is a weird, creepy, dark, bizarre little movie - strongly recommended if you like that kind of thing.'

This film is about a skinhead who goes to prison for killing a black guy. While in prison his younger brother gets involved with the skinheads. When he gets out of prison the older brother (Ed Norton) trys to get him away from that. He's been rehabilitated. I've watched it 3 times and the ending still gets to me. A must see for anyone over 14. I'd advise young people to see it with an adult, preferably their parent if they can. It's a pretty strong movie. Ed Norton has to be one of the best actors of our time. "

S'Michael Moores film Fahrenheit 9/11 gives his left leaning slant on the Bush Adminstration and 9/11, just as Rush and OReilly and Hannity, etc., give their right leaning slant on those topics every day on the radio and TV. I think Moores slant is closer to the truth. There is no doubt in my mind that Bush has screwed us up royally. I cannot remember a time in which there was so much animosity toward America around the globe. Do you know that the day after 9/11 there were candlelight vigils being held in Iran in sorrow and respect for our tragedy? We had the whole world behind us, even after we went into Afghanistan, an action that most Americans, myself included, felt was justifiable and appropriate. The war in Iraq turned all of that good will into hatred. It has alienated former allies. It has divided our nation. It has taken the lives of hundreds of fine American servicemen and women. It has also ruined the lives of thousands of others who have been maimed, both physically and psychologically. It has also taken the lives of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians. The financial cost of the war is tremendous and will certainly have lasting implications for our economy. And what is the big reward for our efforts? The removal from power of a murderous tyrant whom had already been so marginalized by the Gulf War that he posed no real threat to us or our allies. And the Iraqi people are so grateful for our intervention on their behalf that they are attempting to kill our soldiers every chance they get. Fahrenheit 9/11 put a spotlight on certain issues which have been rather puzzling to me, such as, why the delayed and seemingly half-hearted attempt at capturing Osama Bin Laden? Why did we shift our focus from Al Qaeda, the extremist Muslim organization responsible for the 9/11 attack, to Iraq, a secular state with virtually no ties to Bin Laden or Al Qaeda? Moores film might have you believe that the answer to those questions could be big money and power. I dont know that I ascribe to all of the conspiracy theories surrounding the relationships between the Bush Administration and the Saudis, or the role of large American corporations in the rebuilding of Iraq and its prized oil reserves, but I can tell you it all looks and smells very bad. If that sounds cynical, let me just remind you of the corrupting role that big money and power played in the recent implosion of our friends at Enron. In my opinion, this war has become a national tragedy for which the Bush Administration must be voted out of office. If Mr. Moores film helps accomplish this goal, than he is a hero in my estimation.'

S"Hoosiers is one of the best sports movies of all time. Based on a true story, it shows what can be accomplished if you work hard and believe in yourself and those around you. If it weren't based on a true story, you would almost think it is too unbelievable. Yet, that is what makes it so special. The actor who plays star player Jimmy Chitwood is great. Through very few words, he portrays the embodiment of the hopes of Indiana basketball. Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper are perfectly cast, as well. If you're looking to get pumped up before a big game, big night out, or an important meeting or interview, Hoosiers is the perfect choice."

I do however agree with he uses his biased opinion to present his information. But that's what biased film makers do. I don't agree with everything he says, but we need someone like this to oppose the common belief and to open minds in our society. And hey, it won an Oscar, it can't have been that bad. I thought the film was very entertaining. No it's not about guns ultimately, it's about the US being a culture of fear, and guess what guys. I'm from Australia and I've lived in the US for 3 years now. It is a culture of fear. He was right. "

I did hear great reviews of American Beauty and I know that it won best picture, however, I really had no clue what it was about. I was intrigued and captivated throughout the entire movie. Shocking, surreal yet eerily possible. The characters were definitely the extreme, however I am afraid that in this day and age, they weren't too far off the mark. Kevin Spacey and Annete Bening gave extraordinary performances. There are definitely some very disturbing issues being tackled, or explored, but this is surely a movie worth seeing. It was comedic as well as entertaining and thought provoking and ironic."

S'A wonderful movie! Tom Hanks deserved an Oscar for this performance. He plays the part of an Eastern Eupopean man named Victor Navorski from the fictional country of Krakoshia. While in flight to NYC his country is taken over by rebels in coup and his visa into the United States is taken away leaving him stranded in JFK airport\'s international terminal without a place to fly home to nor authorization to visit the U.S. The head security is a punctilious pecker of a bureacrat who leaves him- unable to speak english- to waste for months on end in the terminal, with no money, no food and no place to stay. His true hope is that he can get Victor to leave onto US soil so some other agency will arrest him. Victor however doesn\'t leave and decides to wait even when given opportunities to fudge the truth and gain passage into the United States. In the mean time, Victor lives on condiments and crackers... washes in the sinks and finds a home in a portion of the terminal that is being repaired. Within days however he figures out unique ways to survive- like returning the carts that people use for shopping to receive the quarter deposit. (which he quickly exchanges for cheeseburgers at the BK). The head of security- the Peckerhead- starts to become iritated with Victor\'s ingenuity. He hires someone to return the carts, taking away Victor\'s money. But he\'s unphased, and ends up getting meals from the food cart guy for gaining information about a love interest the guy has. Over the months he learns how to speak english, gets involved with a emotionally confused flight attendant (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) who\'s dating a married man and gets a job with a construction crew working on the terminal. He becomes a local hero to the terminal workers when he calms a man down who\'s having his dad\'s heart medication confiscated by the Peckerhead bureaucrat,-and through recollection of the rules on the forms he had been reading to learn english- lies for the man and says they are for his "goat" which would make them legal to carry. Throughout the story you are warmed by his goodness and perplexed by what it is in the Planter\'s peanuts can he had been carrying- he say\'s it\'s "jazz" in the can. In the end it is revealed he was only visiting New York to fulfill a promise he made to his dead father who had gotten the autographs of every famous jazz musician in a picture he had, except one. Victor flew to America, went through all these troubles to simply put the last signature in the can for his father- to keep his promise. This movie says so much about the human spirit, about the ingenuity of the immigrants who come here and take nothing for granted and about doing what is right- and keeping your word. I highly recommend this movie to everyone and anyone.'

I've never read so many pious comments. I have a history degree and know enough to say that there is a bit of truth in both sides. Maybe every British general wasn't brutal, but some were. After all, we are Americans and are allowed to portray the bad guy on whichever side we choose. Please people, lighten up. Mel Gibson gave us another movie with substance when we're surrounded by these beyond stupid teeny bopper movies. I thank him."

S'all the right elements are in the mix: the pace is fast without being confusing, the humor dry and witty, the action exciting and suspenceful. if anything is missing its the over-blown (and obvious) computer graphics and clich\xc3\xa9s of a doomed futuristic world that have become the standard for sci-fi (or any other summer blockbuster, for that matter). rather, this is an actual story of people with complicated pasts and uncertain futures; it just happens to be set in outer space. this movie should become the touchstone for all movies, but especially sci-fi, wherein the focus is on how each particular person -- in keeping with his character -- reacts to the action and environment.

But really, she was just working hard and stumbled upon something that, even if I were her, few could turn their back on. I liked this movie for some of the more subtle scenes that depict the heartache of a mother who must work to keep food on the table. The best scene was when she was in her car coming back from Hinkley late at night and heard about her baby's first word. Julia Roberts acted in that scene as any other mom whose heart was broken over missing such an important moment would. I cried with her. I tell any single person that doesn't seem to get what it is like for me to watch this movie. Those that took my advice come back and say that they had no idea what true juggling was. I don't agree with her outspoken way of behaving sometimes, but in all she is to be admired."

A lot of the times we see teenage movies using the virtue of teenage agnst as an excuse to start treating teenagers as idiots or trying to instill a patronising life theme. They go from one extreme to another, no spectrum in-between. Teenagers are not idiots their young adults and the more films that stopped trying to depict them as idiots or patronising them the more they would be appreciated. The themes used in this film: teenage mother (Derricks sister), inter-racial relationships (Derrick and Julie), dreams coming true (Julie trying to get into Julliard), coping with death at a young age and peer pressure are all too real. This film used it in a very tasteful and realistic manner. Bravo!!'

When the head guy dies and they have to select a new CEO, everybody votes for the black guy assuming that nobody else will and therefor they won\'t be giving a vote likely to offer them competition.

Rocky replies I'v seen them snails in the garden but i'v never wanted to eat them Every time i see that clip i always laugh. After watching every film roughly 30times i still dont know my favourite. Thats how good these films are.I heard a rumour that a RockyVI is on the cards in which Rocky steps back into the ring 1 more time but we all no when Rocky says just one more fight he really means just another 20.Hope the rumour is true.ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! "

S'I love Quentin Tarantino. Nobody knows how to write a plot like him. I love how the story is told from different points of view and the plot is like a puzzle which slowly fits to create a thrilling climax. There are great twists at the end. Wonderful movie.'

S"I have to give this movie a five because I think Cameron Crowe has such a talent for portraying reality with such entertainment. I really appreciate Crowe's dedication to character development (something often sorely lacking in today's movies), his meticulous attention to casting actors that fit the part, and overall his natural talent for depth. With most movies, there's the hero, who's usually flawless for the most part, the supporting characters and the villains. Usually I'll only like/appreciate one or two of them, but in Jerry Maguire I just fell in love with everybody."

A film i will always watch!'

I love watching my pansy-president sit in front of children for several minutes (after he was told we were under attack) doing nothing. Talk about deer in the headlights. Did he care that he might be a target thus the children just might be in danger? Did he think to ask about his own family? It's just too easy taking shots at this guy. The movie was funny- and certainly far-reaching at times."

S"I love all the Lethal Weapon films and although this one is not my favorite of the series, I still thought that is was a great film. It combined drama and action perfectly, and we can truly get inside the character's heads and understand their emotions. Mel Gibson does a wonderful job of portraying Riggs's eccentric, somewhat troubled personality to the audience. Danny Glover is perfectly cast as the grouchy Murtaugh who has his own insecurities about his age. The chemistry that Glover and Gibson share is simply amazing and it really perfected the film. And boy, what a creepy performance by Gary Busey. Then again, I guess it's not hard for him to take on creepy roles. In the final analysis, Lethal Weapon is definately one worth watching, and be sure to catch the rest of the films as well."

S'This is one great and scary movie. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal Lector and Jodie Foster is almost his equal as the FBI agent. There are some great twists and the dialogue will keep you on the edge of your seat right until the end. Lector is the obvious bad guy, the embodiment of evil, but you find yourself mesmerized by him and rooting for him. This is not your slasher-type horror movie, but an incredibly suspenseful, brilliantly written thriller.'

S'Almost Famous is the best movie I have seen in the last six months. This movie is strong in every element. The casting was amazing. The film gives a great view of the 70s rock and roll scene through the eyes of a young writer. I found the script very unmanipulated, and I never felt as though I was hit over the head with any point or emotion. I found myself in tears at one point in the movie and I was not sure why. I believe it was the sincerity of the story and the telling of it that moved me to tears. The most memorable moments were not words at all, but instead visual images that contained much power and emotion. I would recomend this film to anyone who can appriate a good story, a good cast, and a heartfelt experience.'

S"I felt I had to rate this film to point out an error a lot of people seem to be making. The fighting that everyone is going mad about in the film, while being very accurate and thus nasty to watch, is also supposed to symbolise the inner turmoil going on within Edward Nortons charachter. The person who recommended people watch it but fast forward the fight scene's, is mis guiding people. The fight scenes are as important as the rest of the story, as they are supposed to give you an actualisation of his inner turmoil. Well, in my opinion, anyway. One more point- everyone seems to think that the main charachters name is Jack (Nortons), but if you watch the film again, you will see he only adopts this name after reading an article in a magazine he found in the house he shares with tyler- something about Jack's Kidney or something- anyway the point is we never find out his name, as it's not considered important because all that happens is done by Tyler anyway. Opinionated- I am, Right- your call!"

I really enjoy violent movies and Scarface fits that criteria. Scarface shows how drugs and drug dealing are a major part of american culture.'
