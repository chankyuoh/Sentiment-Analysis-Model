Ray Romano's comic talents quickly gave way to a poorly written script, and extremely cliched jokes about politicians. I didn't even know which one to route for in that election; neither one seemed any better or worse than the other."

S'I loath this film. What a waste of the talented Miss Angelina Jolie and production costs. They could have made twelve films the size of Girl, Interrupted with that budget. There is no plot. There is no entertaining action sequences. There are no interesting characters. There are no interesting back stories. There are parts where they tried to add in comic relief but it came off as dull pointless chatter. Most of the dialouge in this film was so mind numbing all I could hear were clicking sounds. Angelina Jolie is still one very attractive woman and this film proves it once again, yes, I would like to get hot and heavy with this vixen. Beyond that this film has nothing. Absolutly nothing. It is a summer movie. But those are usually entertaining! I have never been so bored in an action film in my entire friggin life! There is a funny part though. In the beginning there is a shower scene with Lara Croft (Which shows more skin than the usual PG-13 fair) and later on is a part where we think we are about to be treated to another Lara Croft shower scene, when all of a sudden it pans down to reveal...A MAN!!! Only laugh out loud part of the movie. All the guys were like OH yea!!! Then the camera pans down to reveal a square chin covered in stubble and a receeeding hair line AHHH SH*T, MAN! Great moment. I wonder if the film makers did this intentionally?'

After watching the movie, I am still not sure what type of unit they were supposedly playing. Anyone that could stay awake for this movie could see the shocking ending from a mile away. The entire set of the movie takes place in Panama with some elite quasi-Ranger type unit doing training. Samuel L. Jackson is the senior non-commissioned officer, though he was wearing specialist rank for a few scenes. The plot was extremely corny and sloppy, with pretty weak character development. One thing I look for in these types of movies is at least some accuracy...but I know there are no women in units like this (score: political correctness 1 - accuracy - 0) and usually units that train together dress in the same uniform. I would compare the type of unit to the one in Predator, only this one had no Schwartzaneggar or any other good actors, much less any action. I think the biggest let-down to the movie had to be the ending, where the shock and awe really wants to make you say to yourself, So what? In any case, please save yourself the $10 and don't watch this movie."

Not even entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. If you're a hard-core masochist in search of punishment, go see an Ed Wood movie instead of this tripe..."

Though I would have given it 2 stars because I didn't sleep through it, my wife actually booed it heartily as it cut to credits. This horrid movie had no mystery, suspense or scary moments (Theme: Married dude dies jogging and is reincarnated as a creepy little 10-year-old boy who insists he is widow's dead Dude husband. Finacee dude (who is a real schmuck) is not amused). Nicole Kidman plays the goofy widow/bride-to-be who gets mucked up in some Mary Kay Latournoesque scenes (which really grossed out my wife). Since the movie is so stinky, I am happy to give the plot away: little boy is not widow's dead dude husband, but actually a mixed-up kid whose head was becocked by some head games by the Anne Heche character (who was, best as I can tell, either dead dude's mistress or first wife or something, I don't even know). No one lives happily ever after, particularly the viewers. Nicole Kidman has been in 3 atrocities in a row (Dogville, Stepford Wives, and this stinker). I think her judgement is impaired since leaving Tom Cruise. Birth was in need of an abortion."

Instead I got another high budget attempt at money making. This film is prpackaged cotton candy crap! I think my I.Q. dropped 10 points just from witnessing such an attrocity. I was ashamed. I am all for religion in cinema. I myself am not a religious man at all even though I was raised in a christian house hold. I can see how some people got a message from Stigmata and I can see how it opens some peoples eyes to a new world but those people must realize this new world they are seeing is based in a lame fictitious horror movie world that is based in no solid evidence and is made to make the schmuks who believe the tabloids paranoid.

In fact, It's friggin annoying. The next time I hear someone say Jive Turkey or Shuga like that again I'm gonna Explode! Not only that, but Goldmember sucks. He is gross, stupid, and also very annoying. The movie only squeezed a couple of giggles out of me. Most of this movie's humor is when one of the antagonists trying to explain something stupid or gross while the other person just sits there staring with a confused look on their face until he is done. Honestly I feel they do this too much in this movie, like when Fat Bastard is trying to explain how bad his fart stinks, or when Goldmember says his stupid Fashza stuff. The only funny parts to me were the beginning, the mole, the subtitles, (ha ha!) and the shadow scene. Other than that, this movie just plain shameless advertising. The Brittney and Ozbourne Cameos were obviously put in there to appeal to their respective audiences. and let us not forget the biggest Audience appeal role of them all: Byonce Knowels herself. The only good Austin Powers chick was Vanessa she is irreplacealble. I think I've seen the bottom of the Austin Powers barrel with this stinker of a comedy movie."

All the so-called humor in this movie consists of sex and d**k jokes, none of which rise above the kind of thing I heard in high school. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not a prude, and I can very much enjoy raunchy sexual humor when it\'s done well, but I couldn\'t belive how wholly unfunny "Porky\'s" was. It was entertaining in a way- I wasn\'t bored by it- but aside from one or two moments that made me chuckle, there just wasn\'t anything funny about it. Why this has become a cult favorite and is regarded as a classic 80s comedy, I\'ll never know. If you want to see a genuinely funny movie from this era, try "National Lampoon\'s Vacation" and skip this crap.'

Will Ferrel's horrendous acting never ceases to amaze me, he just gets worse and worse every movie he comes out with, and this movie is no different than all the other trash he has accomplished thus far. The storyline was loosely based on women's rights in television news. Christina Applegate barely tried in this movie, but I can understand why. (I wouldn't do very good acting next to Will Ferrel either.) She must have owed someone a favor, otherwise I would never be able to understand why she would even be willing to star in such a piece of junk. Do not waste your time or money...it is really awful..."

As tempted as I was to fastforward through the entire thing, I FORCED myself to sit through it in order to give it a fair rating. Granted, the movie producers were going for a black and white effect. Something classy. Memories from an archaic past. Blah blah blah. And this is the only reason why it got 1 star. No, that's not right. It's because I couldn't give it a BIG FAT 0!!! The violence in the movie was uncalled for. Even I felt sorry for those women in the movie and my wife had to leave the room because she was so offended. Thank God my daughters weren't home the night I chose to watch it. How somebody could write up such a ghastly horror wannabe flick is beyond me. It sure felt like a horror, only a cheaper, gross-out scale. Bravo to the producers/writers for giving more serial killers out there ideas on how to murder women. Now we have crazy men portrayed in such acts as hanging women's heads on walls as mantels and eating the live flesh from their fingers and forcing them to watch it being done. Enough said. This was absolute crap! Don't waste your time! I won't even mention the acting because there was not much of it to comment on. "

Whether it is talking about pooping on someone for sexual plaeasur or actually exploding gallons of fresh sh*t all over people. Where does all the sh*t come from? This was never in The Breakfast Club or She's All That. I felt like I had flushed my hard earned bucks down the toilet and then had it explode all over me with sh*t.

Useless premise supported by a typically wan, banal and limp score concocted by that dreadful A.L. Webber, the composer of some of worst crap ever heard by humankind. Add the most overrated no-talent since Bing Crosby/Bob Hope, namely Madonna, who can't sing, dance or act (a triple threat) and wooden, sleazy-looking Antonio Banderas, and you have the workings of a feature film whose entire contents should have been left on the cutting room floor. A friend of mine rented this video for a small social gathering, and we laughed and laughed at how atrociously bad this cultural afterbirth was. Who bankrolls crap like this?

And all Marlon Wayans did was launch lines like, F--- the f---ing mother f---er, you mother f---er. After a while, it gets on your nerves. You know, I wouldn't find that funny, even if I was a juvenile delinquent in the hood. My wife was turned off, and a complained, Can we turn this off, before dozing off about a third through the movie. Tom Hanks was miscast and was probably his worst role since Bosom Buddies.

Obi-Wan, played by McGregor, looks hungover in all of his scenes, while Liam Neeson decided that Lucas did not pay him enough to show emotion. The best actor was the 9 year old who, half way through the film, he also joins his fellow actors in emotionless acting. Stay away from this film.'

S'What happens when you send 16 beer-drinking teens to Mexico? You have The Real Cancun, possibly the worst film in years. I was hoping for something along the lines of The Real World , in which we have interesting characters, but just an extended storyline, with some nudity and sex. Instead, we just get a bunch of drunk teens, with a tiny bit of nudity. This makes Jackass look like a masterpiece.'

S'This film has many conceptual problems as well as my own problems with the politics in the movie. First Joan Allen is portrayed as being a centerist democrat who was once in the Republican party. However her closing statement in her interview by the judiciary committee is filled with many not only democratic, but extreme leftist views, which could never in reality come from a democrat who had at one time been a believable member of the Republican party. This type of positioning in the film only serves to make far leftists think they are actually moderates and further divide the population. Secondly, based on the statement of her politics only serves as a mouth piece for the liberals who produced, directed, starred in, and wrote this piece of tripe. Additionally, any candidate for vice president under the conditions, which she was to be appointed, would not be confirmed. Her views are too radical. There would be no need for the reporting of any sex scandal or adulterous acts. She simply would not be confirmed. Furthermore, Jeff Bridges makes no bones about his want to have a woman (not just a woman but that woman) fill the position of vice president regardless of her experience or qualifications. While many may agree with this approach, I simply do not. One must test the qualifications of the individual before hiring them. In the concluding scenes of the movie, Jeff Bridges requests an immediate roll call vote of a joint session of Congress for her approval. This is followed by a standing ovation by the entire Congress and applauds as though the president were going to war, which is complete and utter BS. If a woman with the views stated earlier in the movie were being brought up for appointment in that unbelievable, entirely unrealistic venue, Republicans and centerists alike would not stand for her or the words of the president. Finally, Jeff Bridges equates her politics with leadership skills and some sort of political destiny she may have. If you vote against her, you vote against a true leader. While a president might do this in reality, Congressmen can see through such propoganda. Apparently, the makers of this film think the American people cannot. My only fear would generally be that the American people might not. However, the movie was rather poorly attended, so I believe most people can tell when someone is trying to veil political dialogue under the guise of suspense.'

This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not that far behind, either. It's like a really crappy rehash of Ringu (Japanese film, 1998; the American remake, The Ring , came out in 2002, the same year as Feardotcom ), with the same basic idea of If you watch this, you will die in X amount of days . I did like the reasoning behind it (a tortured soul wanting revenge), but it just didn't make for a strong story. The true antagonist's motives were never really explained (he just kind of liked torturing women for fun, I guess). The excessive nudity and violence, some of which is highly disturbing, seemed as if it were there only for shock value and nothing more. If your local video rental guy really cares, he won't let you leave with this video."

S"One of the crappiest musicals of all time. Based on a totally trivial premise, i.e., the life of a notorious striptease artist, the only redeeming feature of the story is that it provided a view of that time in American entertainment history when vaudeville faded (for good reason) and the first tame steps toward salacious fare surfaced. The songs are terrible. Rosalind Russell overacts, oversings, overemotes and shouts her way straight through this turkey: instead of coming across as a memorable and remarkable woman, her performance is a flop-sweat approximation of a shrill, pushy, obnoxious, proud, vain, self-centered would-be martyr menopausal biddy. Enough to make you puke. Natalie Wood, usually a fine actress, is miscast in this one, and as a result, isn't too convincing. Karl Malden puts in his typical stolid, measured workmanlike role, and as such, puts in the best performance. It's a wonder they did a remake of this carwreck: maybe they figured that for once, they could top the original. It wouldn't be difficult. But I hear the remake sucked too. Can't make chicken salad out of tuna salad..."

S"The Passion directing was very poor. The only good thing about it was that the language fitted the setting. Besides that, editing and angle shots were not original. There is a big mistake at the end of the movie where Jesus' hands get nailed to the cross. It was discovered a few years ago that Jesus could not have been nailed by the hands, but rather the wrists. The nails could not support his weight. The movie focused too much on the one spectrum of Jesus' life as oppose to overall picture. Mary's portrayal could have been much more effective if she would have appeared to be more convulsive as to see her only son die. Instead, she had the occassional breakdown. It is difficult to imagine who is seeing her child tortured to lack expression and deeper emotion. Frankly, I dont believe Mel Gibson did this movie for the money, but nonetheless should stick to what he does best-acting, not directing movies."

He claims that Bush invited the Taliban to Texas for a visit. Wrong, a Texas oil company that had nothing to do with Bush invited him.

However, about five minutes in, I sadly came to the realization; even the considerable talents of Gary Oldman could not save this hideously convoluted film rendition of that well-known 1960's TV show. As a matter of fact, if you watched the show back in its original form, the only thing that will seem even mildly familiar to you here will be the names of each character. Beyond that, forget trying to relate anything else to the Lost in Space you once knew. You expect the pace to be quick, but this goes beyond that - hitting warp speed from the get go and never slowing down. This way too zippy non-stop action leaves little time left for character development or, at times, even coherent dialog. The result is that you not only do not care about the characters but at times you can't even follow what is supposed to be going on. It really made me wonder what the person responsible for this mess was thinking when the movie was tossed together. Apparently their goal was to throw in a little of this and that from just about every popular Sci-Fi extravaganza to hit the screen since Star Wars . Either that, or they were actually trying to confuse the audience into believing the story may have had some substance. If that was the case, they didn't manage to include enough. Sadly, they also did not manage to capture the light and appealing Sci-Fi quality that originally was Lost in Space ."

His acting was ridiculous and overdone, and while the scenery (but not atmosphere) was visually pleasing, he give the viewer no chance to bask in it the way he should. The drama here is all false."

S"Okay, now this kind of film, even for kids, is a real insult to filmgoers everywhere. In spite of all its dynamic advertising and cool posters, it turned out to be nothing all that special, just a series of grotesque animal fights with dodgy CGI and tacky weapons. The fact that it tried to preach the theory that all cats are evil and that it's only thanks to the companionship of dogs that we're all happy and free didn't do it any favours. I like cats myself, and actually found it alarmingly offensive, particularly the portrayal of all 'cat people' as fat, drippy women and the horrific 'educational' cartoon of Ancient Egyptian history in which everything gets disgustingly distorted. But it couldn't even make the best of such a dubious concept. The script was poor and disappointingly slow-paced, with jokes I'd heard a thousand times before, the puppetry, particularly for the Chinese hairless, was pathetic, the plot was tissue-thin, and acting, both people and voices, was really, really bad. Only the trained cats and dogs gave it any life and soul. Little attempt was actually made to develop the characters, even the animal ones (the least said about those irritating 'humans' the better). The plot? A puppy with an adult voice is accidentally called upon to protect a scientist working on a cure for dog allergies from cats trying to take over the world. Very, very tedious. Your kids deserve better than this. If you're a dog lover, you'd probably be better off giving this a miss. If you're a cat lover, avoid it like hell!"

S'For the REAL truth of this disgusting portrayal go to www.letgodbetrue.com and read The Animated Crucifix. Total blasphemy. The Word of God tells us if any presents to us another Jesus other than the Jesus of the Bible we are to refuse it. Jesus was not a long haired sissy mommas boy. Mary had nothing to do with His work on earth and she had to be saved just like any other. She is dead and in her grave now. She has no power and no authority. This was nothing but a pathetic lie and commercial for the twisted perverted catholic demon doctrine from hell. Woe to those who add or take away from the word of God. This was pure fiction and catholic supstitions and fables. Only the totally Biblical illiterates could believe this garbage.'

It had all the suspense of a half-hearted game of Clue Jr., the story was meandering and wearisome, and the sound quality of the DVD, coupled with the bad British accents made most of the movie sound mushy and inaudible. It was so painfully boring that we rented it for a whole week and popped it in our DVD player 4 nights and fell in and out of repose all week. By the time I woke up for the ending where they reveal whodunit, I commented, I don't even know who they f--k got killed, and angrilly went back to sleep. I don't dig Robert (I hate America) Altman movies. I don't understand why every big-time actor has to make an appearance in an Altman movie. Must be some coastal elite Blue States liberal thing."

This movie was supposed to be a dream come true. Instead I got a convoluted plot, with mediocre special effects (a Stephen Sommers tradition), and the least believable romanian accents in the history of cinema (including that guy at the beginning of Eyes Wide Shut). This movie should be shown in every film academy throughout the world as a cautionary example of what happens when a GREAT idea is given to a mediocre director who, by the way, believes he can translate said idea into a plot and screenplay.

S'I can t tell you what most women want because to be frank I don t give a flying fig. But speaking as a woman, I could have done without this farce. Considering his past success in the Lethal Weapon films, I will say that I feel Mel Gibson has more than proven he can be halfway decent at madcap, insane comedy. However, he needs to realize that his ability to act nuts-o extremely well does not a leading man in light romantic comedy make. This movie made it glaringly apparent that he was never meant to follow in the footsteps of Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, or Gene Kelly. He is, for the most part, an action figure with acting ability who has managed to make some admirable hits within a sea of okay films. If what he has done best so far in his career can be compared to bygone film styles I would say that his forte has been the sweeping epic (Braveheart, the Patriot). What Women Want was almost painful to watch as he clumped his way through this silly, clumsily written game of gender self awareness. Helen Hunt on the other hand after years in fluffy TV sitcom and an acting range that apparently exceeds Gibson s by about 50% seemed more up to the job. But even she couldn t save this pathetic ship full of holes (a few of her lines were actually embarrassingly stupid). Not even semi-funny cameos by the likes of Bette Midler were of much help to this albatross. After forcing myself to stay awake I flipped off the recorder once again thankful I had rented the DVD rather than having paid theater admission and even more glad that I d gotten a special discount rate for signing up with a new video store. Don t waste your time unless you re a major Gibson fan it may be the only way you won t notice the smell.'

S'What a neat movie. Tom Hanks did a terrific job as Forrest Gump a man who does not have a lot of smarts but a huge heart. I loved how events of his life tied in with meeting about four presidents. Forrest has always loved Jenny since childhood they grew up best friends. Their lives take different paths.Forrest succeeds in everything he does, he is the best runner on the football team, He was a hero during the vietnam war, He ran a shrimping busy in honor of his friend Bubba and ending up being a millionaire.etc. He met presidents and was awarded by them for different reasons many times. The movie has a lot of great special effects. putting Tom Hanks in films with real presidents, Making it appear That Dan had no legs. I like the fact that a a person like Forrest who is not very smart but a very kind caring person.falls upon success in everything he does yet money and fame mean little to him just finding Jenny[who had fallen on bad times} and being with her is what is important,I loved how he was a devoted friend, to Jenny, his mom. Bubba, and DAn.A little bit too long but a great movie.'

The true-life story of 2 British climbers in the Andes in 1985 who summited Siula Grande, a 21,000 foot peak, then suffered a horrific catastrophe on the way down. That Joe Simpson survived to tell the tale is beyond belief. The book is extremely well-written, and one might think that the weight of expectations would make any movie pale in comparison. But this movie delivers. Sticking closely to the original tale, in a unique blend of documentary narration by the principal characters, coupled with reenactments so superb and realistic that you forget you're watching a movie, Touching the Void will stick in your mind long after you leave the theater. One of those rare movies that sucks you in so deep and so profoundly that you feel visceral shudders of horror and fear as the tale unwinds. Do not miss this movie!"

The whole point of this film is to question just how much the media influences and controls us from day to day - to the extent that a media company adopts a baby and creates a false world for him and everyone in his life, friends, family and even his wife, are actors. It reflects how we get sucked into shows and believe the characters to be real. The plot is good with Truman realising that the world he is living in is false and he breaks free. This is a heartwarming film and definately teh best role of Jim Carey's career. "

Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), must track down and kill a man who has gone crazy and is running a mini-empire in the depths of Vietnam (I'm not sure the name of the guy, but Marlon Brando played him). A simple enough story. This movie is one of THE greatest films made ever. It's a haunting experience. From tigers to arrows, from Robert Duvall's I love the smell of napalm in the morning...smells like victory , to a jungle-crazy Brando reciting T.S. Eliot around piles of severed heads, this is the ultimate trip. If you haven't seen this magnificent film, you're crazy. See it NOW. It's brilliant.

All I have to do is look at my own country and see that a convicted serial rapist (Iorworth Hoare) won 7million in a lottery win, students in serious debt, messed up travel and ask where my prime minister Tony Blair is to address these problems and realise hes too busy supporting a man who uses his power as an excuse to exploit and invade other countries that didn't pose a single threat to his in the first place. I don't have to ask myself if the war in Iraq was justified all I have to do is look at the death toll and the anger of many soldiers and their families who now question the mis-leading information they were given to invade a country. Whoever makes the choice not to see this film is obviously scared of certain facts that are being presented to them. Whilst I make it a habit to apologise for certain posts in the event of not offending anyone I won't be apologising for this one as its about time we faced reality that the incomptent and social inept who is now present in the oval office has single-handedly assisted himself in making not only fantastic viewing in a documentary that he starred in, but also some of the biggest blunders in political history."

S'What Philip Seymour Hoffman does in the title role is less acting than it is an act of necromancy. I am always in reverent awe when I witness truly great acting, and that\'s what you\'ll see here. Hoffman is nothing less than stupendous as Truman Capote. He brings the character back to life in the same way that Jack Nicholson did with "Hoffa" and George C. Scott did with "Patton." Where the 1967 film "In Cold Blood" focused on the 2 killers, the murders they committed, their trial, and eventual execution, "Capote" focuses instead on the monumentally-talented, monumentally-egotistical and tortured man who immortalized them in his classic "non-fiction novel." The film covers the period from when Capote first read of the Clutter murders in the NY Times in November 1959 until the executions of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock in April 1965 in Kansas. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. Particularly noteworthy are Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith, Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, and Chris Cooper as Detective Alvin Dewey. It\'s very rare that I\'m so enthusiastic about a contemporary movie, so take my heartfelt advice, and run, don\'t walk, to see it. You probably won\'t be able to catch the film at your local multiplex mall theatre (which will probably be playing "Harry Potter" in 2 theatres and the latest Adam Sandler-Tara Reid movie), but if you do revere great acting as I like to think I do, this is one you won\'t want to miss. Trust me. It\'ll be worth the effort of searching it out.'

I loved the way that the movie brought rebuke and scorn to the ignorant homophobics and the damage they can cause to the emotional systems of homosexuals (and some heterosexuals). Throughout the entire movie, I was rooting for Tom Hanks' character to win the fight. A must-see film for everyone, especially the homophobics; a good deal of them need to realize that what they do and say to gays is a mental stab in the back. I can see why Tom Hanks won an Oscar for his performance...one of my all-time favorite movies. Take care, everyone!"

The performances are awesome- I think it includes some of Winona Ryder's best work and of course Angelina Jolie was simply amazing and disturbingly natural as sociopath Lisa. The story has a timeless quality- it could've easily taken place today because the world is just as crazy and screwed up as it was back in the late 1960s. The supporting actors were great too, from Whoopi Goldberg to Brittney Murphy (Daisy is a hoot, of course until she does the obvious later on in the film) to Jared Leto and Vanessa Redgrave, in addition to the various young actresses who played the other patients in the ward. It has some very funny scenes, yet I get tears in my eyes watching other parts, like when the burned girl Polly looks at a picture of herself when she was younger and before she burned herself. I don't think it's just a chick flick - it's an awesome movie and story everyone can somehow relate to! See this movie ASAP!"

S"Me, being a dancer completely appreciated the movie. All those who said that the movie was missing a plot have to understand that difficulties it is to be a dancer. Even as a little kid they pick out every detail about you. They show that detail great in the movie. I personaly thought that this movie was excellent,and the dancing was awesome! There's this one part where they show Eva working hard on her dancing at night...and anyone who's a dancer can understand what thats like! Excellent movie! I totally reccomend it to any dancers out there...not too much for guys though..."

S'I thought Cast Away was a good movie. Tom Hanks as good as a man who worked for FedEX. His plane crashes and he ends up on a tiny deserted island. He has to find a way to survive for the next four years. He opens one of the FEDEX boxes that washed to shore and finds a volley ball he decorates and calls it Wilson.The only thing he has to talk to. His hope of getting rescued to get back to his girlfriend. This movie has drama, humor, and sadness for the main character.i do not want to give too much away. This movie is a little too long. We found it too be a good movie.'

Displaying his action prowess and tremendous acting ability, Mel Gibson was great. While there were parts that were cheesy and hokey, the action and raw emotion of the characters made it easy for me to overlook those parts. I also liked that even though there is a happy ending (I'm not giving anything away here...if you don't know that the U.S. won the Revolutionary War, you have no business using a computer), there were moments of true loss which is inevitable in times of war. I highly recommend this film and be sure to check it out in the theaters."

S"Excessive? Yes. Alarming? Most certainly. Funny? Relentlessly. In this film, Morgan Spurlock merely drove home, in irrevocable, undeniable and not uncertain terms something those of us with two brain cells already know: that 95% of junk food is total crap (they don't call it junk food for nothing) and can be downright harmful to you if you overindulge. However, obviously millions of Americans have less than two brain cells when you consider how many of them are stuffing their faces at this very moment in the countless, various culinary crapatoriums found in every strip mall and on every highway in our grossly obese and flab-disgusting country. It used to be that the average waist size for adult men in the U.S. was 36 inches: today, it's like 42. The average dress size for women used to be eight: today, it's 14. Lazy, ignorant, gluttonous and self-destructive slobs that they are, Americans need a movie like this much more than they need a 700 calorie soft drink, a 600 calorie super order of fries or a 550 calorie Big Mac. What was disconcerting about this film was: (1) Spurlock gained something like 27 pounds in a month of eating McBowel; (2) he was at the verge of compromising his liver from such a high-fat diet (even one of his own physicians was amazed), and (3) eating all that feces on a bun even made him, in the words of his girlfriend, less of a man than he used to be. What was sad in this film was that scene featuring the pretty, but very overweight teenage girl, who, citing the supposedly healthy and fat-reducing qualities of Subway (vomit) sandwiches, bemoans the fact that she can't afford to eat there twice a day. The funniest bit? When Spurlock ate the triple quarter pounder and almost immediately gave it back, hurling out the window of his vehicle. They even panned the camera out the window of the car so that the audience could see the upchuck spewed on the ground. Now, there's a documentarian dedicated to getting all the facts on film!"

S'I lOVED Saving Private Ryan; the best WW 2 two film I have ever seen. The cinamatogrophy was excellent, the acting was amazing, the realizem of the film is right on, and the over all story isjust entralling and inspiring. Steven Speilsberg did a superb job. The story of a sguad led by Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) that storm the beach of Normady in one of the most horrific days in American history. Speilsberg, by the way did a great job of putting you in the middle of this horrible battle. The sguad is afterward sent on a special mission to find and bring home a Pvt. James Ryan somewhere in the German infested hills of France. while looking Ryan the sguad begins to doubt the mission and if it is worth risking the lives of these eight men to save one.Just an encredable film that leaves you with a knot in your throut from beginning to end. I give it ***** stars. Content: Strong Graphic War Violence, and Language (16 F-BOMBS).'

S"Released in 1996 and directed by Joel Coen, Fargo is an eccentric, black comedy detective film set primarily in Minnesota. For the uninitiated, the plot involves dishonest car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) who must find money quick to bail him out of an insurance scam gone bad. His plan is to hire two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can get the ransom from his rich father-in-law. Of course the plan goes bad resulting in several murders which brings the local (and pregnant) Sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) on the case. While hacking through the clues and schemes, Gunderson must deal with the weather, the odd local citizens, and food cravings. In many ways, this film is like a full-feature episode of television's Northern Exposure on steroids given the eccentric characters, climate and screenplay; however, what makes the movie is the performances of Macy, McDormand and especially Buscemi. The latter's portrayal of swarthy kidnapper Carl Showalter is in stark contrast to the slower paced Nordic characters and scenery. In many ways, Showalter is the hare to Sheriff Gunderson's turtle which adds a feeling of tension and inevitability to the story while Macy's Lundegaard spins his wheels in proverbial quicksand only to get deeper into the quagmire he created for himself. The bottom line is that Fargo is not for everyone and is not a typical Coen brothers film; however, for those who like cerebral black comedy, this movie is a must see."

W&G are not just for kids. Some of the adults who are head over heels in love with this dynamic duo are the most worldly, sophisticated, accomplished and even cynical people I know.

S"The naysayers may think otherwise, but Titanic is one of the best movies of modern times and will go down in history as a genuine classic. I guarantee people will be watching and weeping over it 60 years from now, much like we do today with Gone With the Wind. Sure, the dialogue was somewhat corny, but you can't deny the heartfelt and realistic performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet- they had great chemistry as the leads and made us truly connect with their characters. The supporting actors were very good as well, and I liked how well the filmmakers matched the modern actors with the real historic figures from 1912 (Molly Brown, Capt. Smith, Bruce Ismay, etc.) After seeing Pearl Harbor, I've learned to appreciate how much better Titanic is; where Pearl failed, Titanic succeeded. It was successful because we really got to make an emotional investment in the characters, the ship, and the entire setting. Unlike Pearl, where you were praying for the bombing to begin, in Titanic you were just praying they would somehow miss the iceberg!! The sinking sequences and historic drama of what the people onboard went through are realistic and heart-wrenching; you truly feel the tragic impact- I remember sobbing uncontrolably the second time I saw Titanic and cried several other times in subsequent viewings. Call me a sap, but that's what a good movie is supposed to do to you- it takes you into the world of the characters and you feel the tragedy as much as they do. The musical score by James Horner is a classic and I love the Celtic flutes and whistles- they added an interesting touch to the soundtrack, and of course My Heart Will Go On is a beautiful song with a universal theme, not just related to the film. Gloria Stuart was robbed of an Oscar in her amazing performance as old Rose, but at least the film won the 11 other Oscars it deserved. "

This film is near genius accompanied with perfect casting, clear settings and a now very familiar famous soundtrack this all aids a very detailed account of the Corleone family, especially the Don who serves as the main patriarch of the family he loves whilst trying to balance the criminal instinct inside. We don't get to see the real Don Corleone until The Godfather Part 2 - played brilliantly by Robert Deniro. Definitely worth watching."

S"Released in 1997 and directed by Curtis Hanson, L.A. Confidential was a throwback to the original film noir, seedy detective films of the 1940's and 50's. For the uninitiated, the movie tells the story of three mismatched Los Angeles police detectives, Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), who get entangled in several interrelated schemes involving high-dollar prostitutes, police corruption, and organized crime. The story is complex, and the characters are intriguing as they put aside their conflicting personal philosophies and personalities to unravel the conspiracies. James Cromwell does his normal stellar job in a supporting rule (Police Chief Dudley Smith), and Kim Basinger was okay as prostitute Lynn Bracken (though I did not see how her screen time merited the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress). On more technical matters, the pace of the film and cinematography is well done to give the movie that retro film noir aura. The bottom line is that L.A. Confidential is a very good mystery drama along the lines of Chinatown (1974)."

I almost cried when he came to the defense for his friend at the trial. I was happy that the kid got out of trouble with the help of his friend. This was a good drama.

I didn't see it in the theater, and I really hesitated to rent it, because I kept thinking I had to be in just the right mood to handle something so heavy. While that's true, it shouldn't prevent anyone from seeing this film. Spielberg controls the narrative masterfully. If you don't know much about the Holocaust, you should. And this movie is a great introduction."

Tom Hanks is moving and quite amazing as the lawyer afflicted with AIDS and Denzel Washington becomes the homophobic lawyer who takes on the case. Not only does Philadelphia explore the professional prejudice against AIDS victims, it brings us into the personal world..the human side. A very touching movie and sometimes difficult to watch. I specifically remember the scene after the costume party (Washington is trying to discuss the case as Hanks sings and translates the aria) An effective scene.

S"This is probably one of the most compelling dramas that I have watched in my lifetime. Everything about the movie seemed to be up to the par: the acting, the script, the dialogue, the directing and the musical score. Critics of this film like to pander on the fact that it is not entirely accurate. Well, no, it is not. But then again, neither was the Warren Report that concluded that Oswald acted alone in the assassination, despite the fact that a Congressional Investigation in the late 70s suspected otherwise, stating that John F. Kennedy was probably killed by a conspiracy. Even if you are one of those who believe the findings of the Warren Commission, I would hope that you would recognize this film's greatness. Kevin Costner's final speech to the jury towards the end of the movie was simple, to the point, and one of the best that I have seen (better than Nicholson's in A Few Good Men .). JFK is made up of an all-star cast with Kevin Bacon, Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Joens, Joe Pesci and Gary Oldman all at their best. This movie is merely that, a movie. It is not meant to be based on facts, but meant to reflect the opinions of Oliver Stone, Jim Garrison and others. I don't believe some of the things suggested in this film (LBJ's complicity among them), but I still think that it was a very well done fllm. It is a very important film because it is the first Hollywood filmt to at least explore the possibility of a conspiracy in the Kennedy death, and despite many of the film's factual errors, many of its points cannot be denied (i.e. The Warren Commission was a very sloppy investigation). John Williams' score for this film is perfectly suited, and his apparent passion for Kennedy and his assassination is very obvious. The score for JFK made the movie even more compelling, espescially in the beginning when switching from a somewhat Cassandra-like theme to a drum roll, implying a military connection. The film is an investigation into the human spirit and how the vigour and dedication of one man and his team of associates can rise above the highest powers in order to discover the truth about one of the most controversial and historically important events ever. I reccomend this to anyone who is interested in the Kennedy assassination, or anyone who is in the mood for a thought-compelling drama."

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this story when they were struggling young actors and wanted to break into the industry and they wrote a simple story set in their hometown of Boston and some of the main characters based on their Irish-American roots. People who accussed this story of being too simple overlooked what makes a great film which is the heart and soul of characters, a well written script and intelligent dialogue that seems to be lacking in many films today. That monologue that the Professor delivered to Will at the lake was one of the most gripping, moving and emotional speeches I've ever heard on film and that alone made this movie stand out."

Love Stinks makes Fatal Attraction look like a ride at Disneyland. The humor is raunchy at times--but every zinger is so intelligently written that you can't help but get absorbed by the chemistry shared between the beautiful, but oh-so possessive Bridgette Wilson and the nice guy pushed too far antics of French Stewart (from T.V.'s 3rd Rock) Of course, the true lovers of this flick will be the ones that have first-hand experience of bitter break-ups.

Though the laughs and jokes are somewhat crude, they'll leave you red with laughter so long as you have a sense of humour. The storyline of Big Momma's House isn't at all outlandish and further adds to the appeal of Martin's comedic performance. Nia Long also does a pretty good acting job here, playing the daughter who comes home to Big Momma not suspecting that it really is Martin under all that make up."

Tom Hank's character is a lawyer who has AIDS and when his employers didn't know, he was a hotshot who had a bright future within the company, and they made homophobic jokes and 'had a laugh'. When it became obvious that he was ill and that he had AIDS, he got sacked for 'misplacing a very important file'. Tom Hanks decides to fight them and enlists Denzel Washington to help him - he happens to be homophobic - but agrees. Throughout the film you see the friendship between the two develop and Denzel's character reach an understanding about gay people. You see how the trial affects Tom's family and partner and how disgusting his former employers were and how even their lawyer hates doing this case. There are many powerful moments in this film and it will make you cry - you will cry big time - I know i did. "

S"Whoes idea was it to put this film under comedies? This is no comedy. It is one of the most original and beautiful love stories I have ever seen put on film. The performances from every member of the cast (and i mean every member!) are stellar and beyond expectation for such an eighties film starring John Cusack ( remember, One Crazy Summer and countless other shlock crap eighties comedies) this was definatley a change of pass for John Cusack who used this film as a vehicle to establish himself as the talented actor that he is.Ione Skye, yea, this was one of those films she was in and gave a believable performance in before she vanished into obscurity. A light hearted yet moving romantic film about a high school graduate who finally gets up the nerves to ask out the girl of his dreams who hppens to be an over acheiving rich girl who has a very attached father. We'll of course sparks happen and they fall in love and conflict arrise and are resolved by the end of the film. Rest assured it is more entertaining than that. Like Glorybox mentioned, Say Anything contains one of the most classic moments in cinema history. The In Your Eyes Stero scene. This film is about a thousand times better than Cameron Crowes other three films and after watching it once, is addictive. Like heroin. See Trainspotting if you don't know what i am talking about. Say Anything is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone with a heart and a taste for good romance."

I've read the other comments on this movie and find that if anyone had watched the original they would absolutely love this and if you hated the original and its sex jokes don't watch this one. Howeverm with the crazy antics that Jim and his pals get up to will leave you laughing so hard and even has a cheesy love sentiment about it (for you romantic types). All actors pull off their performances with wit and consistency. This is a film to be enjoyed by any teenager, just don't take (what one person noted - the 'mocking' of modern teenagers) seriously.

S"An awesome movie by the don of avant-garde, Mr Quentin Tarrantino. I do adore spaghetti westerns and martial arts movies (as does Tarrantino) and this film was a little of a tribute to both (Even a few of the songs are by the western composer Ennio Morricone!). David Carradine is of course a star from a multitude of cheesy martial arts movies and yet his performance in this movie is enigmatic, measured, intimidating but with a sentimentality that makes one empathize with him (which adds spice to the Bride's ongoing fued with him, which is far more emotional then physical). Uma Thurman is powerful in this movie, of course she doesn't look glamourous at any time during the film, often she looks dirty, sweaty, frazzled, wounded and storied which is exactly the type of raw uncompromising image her character is meant to convey, so I say Bravo! It requires patience to view and fully appreciate this movie. This is the film's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness. The scenes meant to gradually build up tension and the ones containing oodles of esoteric dialogue will bore some but fascinate fans of Tarrantino's style. A ponderous nature and originality is something lacking in Hollywood these days and this film supplies it in bundles which is what I say makes this and all of QT's films rise above the rest."

This movie will make you laugh and cry, just a really good movie."

The performances were excellent, right down to the accents (and yes, people do talk like that in N.D/MN, it wasn't an exaggeration, I was born in Fargo). I think this was William H. Macy's best performance (portraying Jerry Lundergard). I love it when the finance company keeps hounding him about the VIN numbers for the vehicles, truly helarious. I questioned why the movie was called Fargo. After all, the only scene that took place in Fargo was the first five minutes of the movie, where the deal was set. The majority of the movie took place in Brainard MN. Then I finally got it. Would you rather see a movie called Fargo or Brainard ? Makes sense, huh?"

S'5 stars, but a reserved 5 stars. An excellent movie that was also incredibly offensive and revolting at the same time. Why, you ask? The depictions of the lows of human nature which the characters enter are 100% revolting and disgusting. If you have a weak stomach, are opposed to depictions of sex, violence, drug abuse, etc., by all means DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. For those who can appreciate the extremely strong anti-drug message in this movie and stomach watching it, you will not want to watch it again. Once is enough. However, one of the primary reasons I give 5 stars is its possible service to those considering/experimenting with/involved in drug use. If you catch your teenager using or experimenting with drugs, preview this movie and STRONGLY consider making them watch it. It is offensive, but it can serve a purpose. For that, and the fact that it is generally well made, I find I must give it a great rating, despite the fact that I wanted to vomit. '

He played one of the cons yelling at the new arrivals near the bigining of the film. He was the one acting like he a had a fishing rod.

The storyline is a bit predictable, yetthat is not the point of the film; this movie shows how one act of violence can tear a family to shreds. This is a very quiet and disturbing, and i litteraly mean QUIET! There are many scenes in the film that show a character doing something with no speech. There is one disturbing scene where Spacek is sitting on the couch smoking a ciggarett and staring at the tv screen with this look of shock. its a disturbing scene! All and all an A+ movie!

It's got an impressive cast - Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, James Cromwell, Doug Hutchinson - and the way that Death Row (E Block) is represented is beyond the mortal imagination of most human beings. Both the inmates and the guards are humanized, and it shows the horrors of the electric chair and the many ills of our death penalty system. John Coffey the character is an almost nonfictional representation of anyone who has ever been wronged by the criminal justice system. I applaud the director and actors. Take care, everyone!"

S'The best and most captivating civil war film to date. Denzel Washington should have recieved an oscar for his performance. One of the few films anymore which is inspiring and very heroic.'

I liked it much more on the second viewing than the first; there aren't many movies that I can say that about. Mulholland Drive is great also."

S"My faverout movie of all time, I'll say that first. Released to a hail of critisism. In fact they gave it an X rating, virtualy unheard of outside the world of hardcore pornography, lol. Scarface in its time boasted an all time record amount of swears, making use of the F word almost 200 times. But this film is worth more than its dated shock value. Operatic and overblown, this film apeals to anyone looking for a film with a minamum amount of arsing around - the is no love sceans no attempt to bring shade or depth to Montana's character, he is defined by his actions as a pure bad guy - the ultimate anti-hero icon. Endlessly watchable and quotable, you'll either love it for its in you r face vilolence and agression or hate it for its bloatedness and linear simplicity. Its all about one scumbags rise and fall, and alot of Coke and carnage! "

S'Saw this today! It was great. Entertaining, warm and a pleasure to not be distracted from the film by better known child actors...a wonderful movie. Kamy: Found this re: cat with spectacles on a blog: "Maybe it was the crayoned marking that Edmund did when he went into the witch\'s house earlier on. Did anyone notice that he was painting a mustache onto one of the stone statues? It looked like he had grabbed black charcoal, but it could have been another color. I wasn\'t sure if it was a cat, but I will make sure I pay close attention when I go back to see the movie, on both points, because I didn\'t see what you\'re referring to." '

S'Talk about a trip through Hell! Apocalypse Now is both real and surreal and most definitely devastating. This movie captured the overall mood of the Viet Nam era with all its emotional turmoil, political insanity and feeling of emptiness more completely than any other film I have ever seen. I saw it when it was first released and sat there wondering for awhile why the theater seemed so odd. Then it suddenly occurred to me as I was leaving that nobody in the place had moved, spoken or even gone to the bathroom for the last hour of the show.'

For those into submarines, this one ranks right up there with Crimson Tide and Das Boot (if you use subtitles and not the dubbed version).'

S"A lot has been said about the opening battle sequence in this movie, and when I went to see Private Ryan at the cinema I thought I was prepared - after all, I have enjoyed watching a lot of films that contain a lot of violence and it has never really phased me. Wrong! I think Spielberg has captured the essence of large-scale conventional warfare at it's most real, short of actually being there. After the initial fight scene subsided I had to remind myself to breathe. And no, I don't think the violence is at all gratuitous - WWII resulted in the deaths of some 20-25 million soldiers and that's how it is. To soften the blow on the audience would be insulting and patronising. Anyway, the cast acts its way through the film flawlessly and I really felt for each and every GI that featured (the Germans are rather faceless, with one exception). Again, the battle at the end was grueling to watch and I didn't feel its impact was diminished by having sat through the first one. The opening and closing scenes with the old veteran some may find a bit sentimental flag-waving, and the comments about Montgomery were a bit grating (I'm English by the way), but the film is supposed to be from the viewpoint of one squad not a history textbook, so I can forgive that. Overall, one of THE best war films ever made and technically, I think, one of the best shot and directed movies ever."
