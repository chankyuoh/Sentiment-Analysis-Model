Whatever happened to good old clean comedy? Now, I'm no prude, but is anything besides sex funny? Of course it is! Take a look at Beverly Hillbillies, I Love Lucy on TV or Toy Story 2, Some Like it Hot as far as Movies. Rated R, which is an underrate in my opinion."

S"I do not like this movie because it condones witchcraft and black magic, which is clearly evil and something we are to stay away from. When we are dealing with witchcraft, we are dealing with demonic powers, because we don't have magical powers. There is no such thing as using magic for good. Maybe the person may be using it for good in their mind, but that power is from the devil. He is mucking around with their mind and fooling them into believing that they are using his power for good. There are lots of Bible verses that speak against witchcraft, magical arts, astrology, psychics, fortune tellers etc. Some people may think that white magic is good, but whether it is black or white, it is still evil and God hates it. Black magic is using physical magic eg spells and doing a lot of the stuff on Harry Potter and Charmed. White magic is dealing with psychic powers, manipulating people's emotions and will, fortune telling, astrology etc. Using Satan's power is like throwing your steak dinner to lions. They will rip the steak up and eat it, turn around and rip you to pieces. Satan is a horrible, unfair bank dealer. Most banks charge interest, but the devil lends you money, but charges 200% interest."

A shopworn and tired premise supported by a really limp script, humdrum score and featuring one of biggest no-talents ever as its female lead. No wonder this picture bombed and set back the trumped-up and artificial career of Mariah Carey about ten years. That bimbo isn't bad to look at, but her singing reminds you of the girl at high school Talent Night who had a couple of voice lessons. All the taste and delicacy of a jackhammer, every line imposed upon by pointless and unessential vocal gymnastics. Dreadful. Who listens to this crap anyway? The only reason this no-talent ever got to the public eye is that she dropped for that idiotic T. Mottola when he was a highflyer at Sony. Maybe there's a future for her in stroke films."

Besides the ending was so predictable. The verdict could have been guilty or somebody die. They also show The US government as hypocrites. They can kill 80 civilians because of 3 navy men.

S"This is up there with one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Two hours of my life I'll never get back! For those of you who think this depicts real life, I feel very sorry for you. This negative, immoral, movie was one of the most depressing representation of humanity I have ever seen. Although, it IS a study in bad decisions humans make every day in their lives. If this is what is going on in modern-day relationships, I feel very sorry for this generation. However, in all of my experience, I see less of this kind of muck, and more people trying to behave. I used to LIKE Clive Owens, and the weird thing is, in real life, he's happily married with a couple of kids! I certainly didn't think this movie did anything for Jude Law's or Julia Robert's careers! If this is life, then leave me out of it. I felt like taking a shower at the end of this movie I found it so disgusting (and, believe it or not, I'm NOT a prude). For those of you who know people who live this way - GET NEW FRIENDS! Sorry, but life is too short to waste on people who have no idea that happiness resides within, not jumping from bed to bed!"

Its hard to imagine that creative, well-acted, upbeat movies like Star Trek: Nemesis, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, Pokemon 4Ever, Daddy Day Care, and Down with Love get bad reviews from critics and bad mouthed by most other teens. First of all, the plot is patently offensive. A group of high school teens vowing to lose their virginity by prom night? It would be good if they were rejected and realized that they had to treat women with respect, but that doesn't happen. Instead, sex is treated just like it is any other need--such as air. Shockingly, the women in this movie are just as perverted as the males! And, you think that makes this movie filled the gills with bad role models--stand by for more! For example, an extremely mean-hearted prank is played on someone causing them to have...stomach problems. Are the people who do this punished? No. Of course, profanity rules the day in this movie that had to be cut multiple times from being NC-17. In the end, the males aren't taught a lesson or thrown in jail and the females don't go seeking gentlemen. Thus, this movie is a complete waste of time--full of NO humor, NO positive role models, NO one on the side of good, NOTHING."

The characters were weak, and the supporting actresses/actors were bad. The action/fighting scenes weren't very good either. But that's not even the worst part. The dialogue was literally laughable (the sort you would expect from a weak story-lined action movie ten years ago). Here's one example: Let's just kick some ass! It's what we do best. Even the background music was dis-tasteful, imagine theme music from the game Quake 2, except much much worse. I would recommend saving your money and not going to see this one... if anything wait until it comes out on video. "

S"Hands down, the best movie that I have seen this year. Directed by the same guy who directed Good Will Hunting, the movie has a similar feel to that movie. Older father figure helps young genius reach his potential and learns something about himself along the way. Yet, it is very different and brilliantly written. Sean Connery and Rob Brown are both great (I won't be surprised if they are up for Oscars). You walk out of this movie feeling good, but you aren't clobbered over the head with sweetness. I can't recommend a movie more highly. There is also a surprise cameo towards the end which will give you a chuckle."

S'With a small amount of trepidation, I walked into the theatre with my spouse to see this film yesterday evening. Once I got past the gratuitous/obligatory homophobic case of the heebie jeebies, I settled in and realized why this picture is being nominated for awards left and right. It is an excellent movie. And homosexuality is not even particularly "central" to the theme. Brokeback Mountain is a love story. And it\'s a sad one. I noted above that the "gay" component of this film is not central to it because lots of love stories are sad. Romances between people fail to flourish or "succeed" for any host of reasons. This is not a human experience limited to queers. The doomed nature of this relationship is as much a result of the choices the protagonists make as it is of the unwillingness of many in larger society to accept gay couples and relationships. The performances by both lead actors, particularly Ledger, were sensitive and not over the top. Ledger\'s character was truly the most haunted/conflicted by the relationship the pair develops as young men. The price of the tickets to Brokeback Mountain were a good investment and I\'m glad I saw the movie. I left the theatre feeling rather sad for the fates of both characters and the story I saw has had me thinking all day. '

S"One of the best movies you've probably never seen. A clever crime caper, full of unexpected plot shifts that have to be carefully watched for in order not to get lost. Michael Caine's first American movie (quickly snapped up after the success of THE IPCRESS FILE), playing devilish mastermind Harry Dean opposite Shirley MacLaine's ditzy innocent Nicole Chang. With the help of John Abbott's master sculptor Emile, they concoct a scheme to rob a priceless sculpture from one Ahmad Shahbandar (done with regal splendor by the underrated Herbert Lom), a wealthy recluse who longs for a remembrance of his late wife (who just so happens to be a dead ringer for MacLaine's character). This trickery gains Dean access to Shahbandar's ritzy apartment complex, where the sculpture must be smuggled out of using a complex series of expected events that require split-second timing. As you might expect with a dark comedy, nothing comes off right until the surprising ending (which I won't give away). If you're exhausted with green-screen explosions and puerile sitcom extensions, try this 1966 heist yarn to appreciate a time when movies were talent-heavy and story-driven."

It is a drama about a simple man, who is ready to sail with the wind, with full gusto, just like the feather in the opening/closing musical suite. His life, the way he 'simply' goes through the turbulent times around, as well as his 'Run', and the feather,..they are ALL SYMBOLIC. Nobody expects real life to be like that, but it is a beautifully crafted DRAMA (critics are U listening) that forces U to ponder upon another way of looking at things! Great acting, wit, direction and music (perhaps the best cross sectional selection of greatest American classics)."

One of the great acting challenges of our time, and Tom Hanks lives up to expectations. He gives an Oscar-worthy performance, and propably would have won had he not already captured two other awards earlier in his career His co-star, Wilson, really stole the show and became the star everybody loves. Helen Hunt did her best in what essentially was a throw-away role, a role that was poorly written. Her photo in the locket was the real preformance here. Still, CASTAWAY remains one of IJR's favorite flicks and IJR says check it out!!"

S"Pulp Fiction is one of the most eclectic films ever made. That being said, it's one of the most well-blended films ever. The stories, and certainly odd ones at that, are told to us not in chronoligical order, but mixed together in a way to evoke terrific power and emotion. The dialogue is most definitely the BEST dialogue I've ever heard in a film. Although it employs more explatives than usually heard in movies in 1994, they are used in the right places, adding the right feeling to the lines, unlike most modern films where the words are added to give them movie a R rating. The visiual style is excellent as well. Quite possibly, the best movie of 1994, the best year for movies since 1939."

S"If you are easily offended by rap music and don't like to hear a lot of swaring this movie is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you want a rough, uncompromising look at prostitution and breaking into the music industry this movie just might be for you. This is not the story where the poor boy makes it rich because he's a nice guy who simply gave it a shot. Instead its a gritty glimpse of a profession that, while glamorized in today's pop culture, is shown to be dirty and entrapping. It turns out there might be people in this business with emotions and self-asteem, despite the tremendous stresses they experience. If you want a rare story-driven movie, about a subject not often dealt with, give this one a try, but I don't think you can give it a very objective evaluation if it conflicts with your own values and lifestyle.

The whole time, you know where the movie is headed, but you still can't prepare yourself for the emotional wallop when it happens. Hilary Swank is one of the best actors out there - she plays the tough trailer park girl perfectly, and Clint Eastwood is at his understated best. Morgan Freeman plays exactly the same role he did in Shawshank Redemption, and again it works for him. But I think the story is what makes this movie work. Inspiration followed by devastation.

S'"Trekkies" is a rather endearing portrait of Star Trek fandom. Pretty much as you\'d expect, this means lots of interviews with omnipresently costumed obsessives whose living rooms perfectly resemble the bridge of the Enterprise. However, the most entertaining reflections on the Trek fandom come from the experiences of the Star Trek actors themselves. Brent Spiner and Denise Crosby comment on spookily realistic naked portraits of themselves sent by fans, John De Lancie recounts people confronting him on the street to ask if he can really resurrect the dead and Nichelle Nichols talks of how a young girl once saw her on television at a time when black actresses in important roles were virtually non-existent, and was inspired to pursue an acting career herself. That girl\'s name was Whoopi Goldberg. It\'s feel-good stories like this that make the film so pleasant. Star Trek, whilst being merely a popular television franchise, has always espoused fundamentally good moral messages like sexual and racial equality, acceptance of diversity and the ideal of working for the purpose of fulfillment rather than simple monetary gain. Though often satirical, the film basically presents the idea that Trekkies have absorbed from Star Trek, amongst an advanced knowledge of Klingon linguistics and a penchant for wearing pointy ears, some pretty good axioms to live by.

S"A wonderful film. Jamie Foxx showed me more of that special something I saw in (don't laugh) Any Given Sunday. Foxx literally becomes Charles for this film-taking on the mannerisms, carriage and voice of Ray. The movie showed the genius as well as the tragedy of this very human talent. I was particularly moved by the portrayal of his mother. A woman who you would expect to resent her son(s) (1. raising two young boys on menial labor, 2. as a stunned child Ray stood by as his younger brother, drowned, 3. Ray becomes blind and a heavier burden within the year of his brother's death), instead his mother never lays blame at Ray's feet, loves him in a strong brave way and sacrifices by sending the last child she has away (this must have broken her heart) to attend a school where he might learn enough to become someone. The movie's epiphany is where Ray's mother (in dream/fantasy sequence) tells Ray that, for all his genius and success, he has failed in his promise to her by becoming an addict. A wonderful message about motherhood."

Some of the dialogue in it is hysterical, and there's even a bit of a history lesson, if you're paying attention. This movie reminded my of the Indiana Jones movies, which I also enjoyed. A good clean action flick for the whole family, IMHO"

She tried to minister both the murderer's family and the murder victim families. This film is full of great quotes, such as you shall know truth, it will set you free. The execution scene in the end, was very VIVID, it gave me chills to my spine. It made me think I was watching a documentary, that's how powerful it was. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone, interested in the subject of capital punishment and wanting to learn more about it."

It was written by at that time and unknown(Sylvester Stallone) and acted by largely a cast of unknowns as well and shot on a very low budget. It was also the first movie to use the steadycam. Yet it won best picture at the 1976 Oscars overcoming all odds..just like Rocky did in the movie. I can totally relate to the character of Rocky, a man so down in life and nobody gives him a chance they look down on him. It's just a movie about overcoming obstacles in life..and even if you don't succeed completely, atleast you went all the way."

S'In gruesome perfection, \'Hostel\' gives a taste of hell, an exhibition of depravity so deep that man actually pays to sin in the most desperately wicked ways, and Satan laughs at making man his "b*tch." Three guys go into a hostel...likeable enough, only flirting with sin really, on a trip, just trying to be happy. But one by one they end up victims of a pay-to-torture sadism club, $25,000 for an American. Near flawless story, characters, acting, directing, set, music, production. Even an empathetic protagonist and a denouement, but if your resolution must be happy happy, save your $. \'Hostel\' fleshes out and inspires responses to evil--despair, energization, or numbness. This movie is filled with nudity, drugs, and extreme gore, but it\'s not glorified, and so I recommend \'Hostel\' for exposing man\'s sinsickness and hope that viewers might seek the Cure. (Last week\'s news here in Florida showed how this sadistic tendency is more and more out now, not restricted to government torture or internet sites: one man was arrested for double murder after spending money for bus, taxi, and hotel to go manhunting in a park just because he said he felt like killing, and another 2 guys were arrested for murder after videotaped beating homeless men smiling through it all.)

TV almost always cuts out great dialog and scenes that are classics alone. What the movie doesn't tell you is that this small town team also had to win two games in the Semistate round and an afternoon game in the finals. This means they won two games a day three consecutive weekends after their Sectional to win the state. Not to mention they (The Milan Indians) went to the final four the year before (1953). Milan had a total enrollment of 161 in 1954. While you are at the video store, get a copy of Breaking Away. It's another underdog sports story that won Academy Award for Dialog. "

This is by far the most popular film he's ever directed and yet it may not even be the best. In Pulp Ficiton he takes what he did in Reservoir Dogs with unchronological story telling and refines it beautifully. Reservoir Dogs my be the more exciting of two, but this one is more concise and important. Best Scene: Jules Winfield's pre-killing monologue. "

S"Update; having seen this excellent film, the soul-love portrayed transcends the sexes of the people involved, and takes us on a human journey of love that, through fear of society's constraints (not God's)they are unable to naturally express. To conform, they get married and in the process hurt more people, yet not so much as they are hurting themselves. A film through which you will experience the depth of their love and understand that love is greater than the two protaganists.Superbly acted. Norainbows, if you didn't understand it, you've got a problem. Not only has this film won the top prizes at Cannes and Venice but the Film Critics and Reviewer's Top Award. It sounds a cracking good film and can't wait to see it. For those who think it's just a gay film..well, above all, it's a love film and for those who think it's misrepresentative of cowboys, what do you think went on when guys were up in those mountains on their own? Louie: King Kong! My fears are confirmed that you have a lot of growing up to do, Louie. "

S"MUNICH is a triumph. (JAWS : fish bites boat.......... ET : a fuggly alien can be cuddly....... SAVING PRIVATE RYAN : WWII was about dumb-dumb Matt Damon ? ) This movie is Speilberg's redemption song. Eric Bana is a knight on a quest to vanquish evil, but as we know, like the poor, our lord said evil will always be with us...our best friend our intimate enemy. The violence and the shock value puts other hacks to shame........ ( Scott / Scorcese / Attenborough / Coppolla / Peckinpah / Tarantino etc ) These lessons of Munich will be learned & re-learned, off screen & off -----God help us."

By far one of the most depressing films ever but obviously the point of this film is not to entertain. It is an unconventional, disturbing piece meant to cause you to think. This film dragged me through so many emotions from disgust to empathy to nausea to extreme sadness. It is clearly not a mvie for the faint of heart as the depiction of these character's lives is relentless and painful. But its acting is magnificent and its storyline touches a deep chord in the heart."

Sweet goodytwoshoes lady in Detroit took in numerous foster children through the years but actually adopted four of them that were in unique ways unadoptable/degenerates. Anyway, years later she is shot, prompting her four now adult sons to reunite and seek out the truth about the shooting. Recognized most of the actors, though can't recall names, except Mark Wahlberg (one of brothers) and Terrance Howard (one of cops on case). Motown soundtrack. I think most everyone would enjoy this never boring good-vs-evil redemption movie, though some bad language and a bit of violence and sexual explicitness."

S"de palma's direction can never grow stale: it's the visual definition in my opinion of panoramic, a real tribute to this vaguest of remakes. oliver stone, on the other hand, i think, has a rather definite tendency to date himself. i don't know if you can blame him for the cheesy music, but the story is very much stuck in its era of drug-built decadence and superficiality, and political cowardice. fortunately, pacino's scarface can never be dated. he's a guy with his own tweaked sense of right and wrong; a murderer who won't let anybody date his sister, a criminal who values loyalty and honesty above all. like all great characters, he has a tragic flaw. without giving anything away, it's that the same courage that puts him on top of his criminal empire alienates him from the kings of the underworld to a fatal degree. this is the real strength of the film, the character of tony montana, but the direction is so smooth, and the action so overwhelming, so mindblowing, and the mood so often dark and disturbed that it's easy to get distracted. the kid with no options becoming a crook to get the world and everything in it may be a reusable theme, but no one will ever do it as well as pacino, de palma, and stone, because no one else could find the psychological depth that they did in the title character, and mask it all in such beautiful carnage. you love the guy, even though he's a vicious monster. great, great movie.

She loves her life, has the perfect Christian friends, and a perfect Christian boyfriend . . . at least she thinks so, until he tells her: I think I'm gay. Ouch. She goes through drastic measures to try to save him, and suddenly she realizes how imperfect her perfect Christian life really is. This movie does go into a lot of issues which may be considered offensive, but it passes very strong messages about tolerance, understanding and true friendship. Extremely funny."

You will not believe your eyes when you see what she goes through. Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans (appearing in his first dramatic role) are equally believable in this anti-drug film that does not glamorize its subject matter in the least. And it's brilliantly directed--you feel as if you are on the drugs with the characters, because of this direction. A perfect film. "

S"Sergio Leonne's final, loving ode to the medium he adored is possibly his best. The greatest poets can describe the ineffable through words, but Leonne, the filmmaker, can the describe the indescribable without using words. One of the first scenes, where Noodles (De Niro), as an old man, returns to the bar that was the focal point of so much of his storied life, is a perfect example of this. The camera pans gradually and contemplatively over black and white pictures as Noodles looks agape, lost in his memories. He then slowly walks towards what appears to be an unremarkable closet or storage area, but Noodles, and the film, treats it as if it were hallowed ground. Entering the closet, he gazes through a small opening in the wall and sees the elegant dancing of the girl he used to spy upon as a pubescent boy, now looking mournfully into his lost youth. As I watched, I felt deeply affected, as if the old Italian director had somehow communicated to me what it was like to look back on a lifetime of memories. I was so profoundly moved, and the film had barely even started yet! The movie documents the life of Noodles and his friends, young hoodlums in prohibition-era America, and how they grew from boys to men, and from small-time thieves to established gangsters. An intriguing duality is raised because as the boys grow in their capacity for crime, so too does their sense of loyalty and love towards one another. Through the course of life though (especially one of a criminal), the capacity for loyalty is tested by ambition, and love can stray into the darker shades of obsession. As disarmingly whimsical as the film can often be, it has equal capacity to be extremely grim and disturbing. It's truly a biopic that explores both the very best and the very worst aspects of humanity. Make sure to catch the full, unedited 227 minute version of the film, as though the movie is long, not a second of Leonne's final masterwork is missable. "

It made me think about my own relationship and it helped so if you are having problems with your relationship, I suggest that you take your boyfriend to see this movie and I am sure that everything will be fine after that. I could see this movie over and over and over again and I can't wait until it comes out on VHS so I can buy it.

The town's mayor is not pleased with Vianne and what he thinks she represents, and he attempts to sabotage her. The story develops nicely, with several interesting sub-plots, and the acting is terrific. I'm not surprised in the least that Juliette Binoche was nominated for Best Actress for her role in this movie. Johnny Depp and Judi Dench are both great, too. Although the movie deals mostly with relationships, it moves at a good pace and is never boring. If you're looking for a nice movie without a lot of violence or sleaze, Chocolat would be a good choice. I suggest arming yourself with a bar of chocolate before entering the theater..."

I loved the breath-taking cinematography, the acting, the score, the subtle messages of confusion and the over all story but I did not feel a connection between Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar. I did not understand why, when they were not consummating their relationship, they were distant; apart. I felt that this was a flaw in the movie that weaves in and out of a 20-year \xe2\x80\x9clove affair.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I realized the brilliance of this movie- it examines the relationship between two real men who are struggling with their own sexuality and identity while trying to express a pure love they do not understand. They simply don't know what to do with their with their intense feelings, except to express with child-like frolicking, fierce testosterone driven anger and fierce love-making (there are only two brief scenes so straight men can watch it easily). GO SEE THIS MOVIE for the subtle topics it tackles, love, loss, the blame society must take for robbing these beautiful creatures of their pure love, and for victimizing people who simply want to understand themselves and the one they want to love. This is by far a breathtaking masterpiece and the best movie of the year."

S"I am an Australian and hvae juts watched 'Bowlinf for Columbine. I think that Moore has done a fantastic job of this documentary. I was shocked. Aboslutely stunned and disgusted. The way Americans go around with guns is very wrong. I found it very emotional, and right fully so. The scene from inside Columbine High were enough to make me cry. how disgraceful tat such a hting could happen! Whjat is America doing to make this happen?! I know many Americas are angry at being portayed in a negative way, but please deal with it. Most of you are decent people, BUT anyone who agrees with what Charles Heston did, going to Columbine to promote guns a day after the shooting and also where the six yera old innocent girl was shot, to be all happy, hahaa, own a gun, its so great blah blah blah ITS TOTALLY UNACCPETABLE! how disrespectful! What a waste of life that man is! I was also shocked at how America gave money to Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. Well whats happening now?!?!? oh we hate Hussein, oh kill Osama! They are murderers... Weel take a look in the mirror!!! Abosolutely disgusting. Whether the claims are true or not, and i wil admit maybe moore was too interetsed in money, he has stil opened my eyes to things maybe i wihs i could close my eyes on again, and i know America wants to do tat, BUT DOT! open them!!!!! MAKE YOUR GUN LAWS STRICTER!! save the children. I love Columbine! (also how disgusting the gun trucs had 'we are columbine on them!) thankyou Mr Moore, 'Bowling for Columine' was truly AMAZING!"

S"Award-worthy documentary of the dance movements clowning and krumping, with both presented as alternatives to gangbanging. Moviegoers are drawn into the lives of individual dancers, including Tommy the Clown who started it all. Music and butt-popping dancing throughout, with the highlight being a large arena competition. If offensive language bothers you, it's mostly at the beginning and not gratuitous. If Christianity bothers you, it's mostly at the end and also not gratuitous. Inspirational (Rize) without being sugar-coated; plenty of cause for both laughing and crying. Hopefully, some grant $ and job offers will come out of this...and understanding and hope."

Murray Abraham is absolutely transfixing in this film. He does an incredible job as the aged Saliery. His expressions, mannerisms, and speech is spot on. If you've missed this then you've really missed out."

While I normally do not care for movies that involve serial killers, this movie is a MUST-SEE for those seeking a good Jodie Foster movie. It can be kinda scary at times as well. Not a recommended movie for children however.'

Jerry Lundegaard has some financial problems so he hires some people to kidnap his wife and they would demand a ransom from her rich father. Things take a turn for the worse when they end up killing Jerry's wife and the pregnant police chief is hot on the trail. William H Macy is excellent as Lundegaard. Francis McDormand is funny and refreshing as the police chief. Steve Buscemi is superb as the violent psychopath. The movie is fresh, funny, violent, and thrilling. Quite possiblly The Coen Brothers best film."

S"Goldfinger (the third film in the James Bond film franchise released in 1964) marks the point where the series reaches cruising altitude and speed. All of the now expected elements are here: suave, lady-killer Bond (Sean Connery), Q's gadgets; Batmobilish automobile, tongue-in-cheek puns, and a killer theme song by Shirley Bassey. One also gets the feeling that Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) is every bit the equal of 007, though on the dark side. Goldfinger is the first in the series in which Bond has any real and extended interaction with his chief nemesis resulting in a richer film and better character development. The movie also introduces the exotic sidekick with Oddjob (which was revisited in The Man With The Golden Gun (1974)) and returns to using intriguing names for the primary Bond Girl in the form of Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. The only real complaint with this film is the real time editing problem near the end of the movie when Bond is blindly trying to defuse a bomb as a nuclear scientist rushes down the steps to do it himself."

S"Theme is about how everyone has their own sense of what finding beauty in life entails. The film illustrates that the traditional model of American beauty -- a nice home with your family in the suburbs -- can be a shallow facade and not as fulfilling as it appears. The theme suggests that deviating from glorified suburban ideals (by taking a fast food job, dating someone younger, befriending a misfit, being mistaken as gay, etc.) will bring you fierce recrimination, yet may be the only way for some to discover true happiness in life. The movie wasn't designed to be an uplifting crowd pleaser, as much as one that provokes with its message. While I was uncomfortable watching the movie at times, it was intriguing and affecting enough for me to want to view many key scenes a second time immediately afterward. As the movie states, where some might just see an empty bag floating in the wind, another might see beauty."

Piper Perabo, who played the lead character Violet has that Aww shucks sexy girl next door look that you would either want for your daughter or girlfriend. The music was great and I personally like LeAnn Rimes who plays herself in this movie and does the actual singing. I like movies for their entertainment value.
