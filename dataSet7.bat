The few interactions between the characters were boring and I still think they were the least worst parts of the movie. My sister went shopping right after the movie had begun and when she returned 2 hours later she asked me why it was still in the same place as when she left. To sum it up: There are surely better things to do with your time. Not even worth renting. People only praise it because they think it makes them look intellectual. '

S'Three words describe this movie to me - dull, dull, dull. And it was saying a lot for me to get this impression because I first saw it when I still enjoyed westerns and still didn t have a clue as to how little this folklore had to do with reality. And I especially enjoyed the ones that had a love story going on. HOWEVER, I just could not take the practically comatose subtlety of Gary Cooper s low-key acting style. He not only put me to sleep but he also looked more like Ice Princess Grace Kelley s father than her hubby. Unfortunately, unlike the western genre, this denial of masculine age and the pairing of old dudes with young chicks still persists in Hollywood. And, it still seems like exactly what it is a pathetic attempt to make the man feel and look younger. Oh, and by the way - it STILL doesn t work.'

Group #1 was laughing hysterically from the time the static came on to the time the credits at the end ended. Group #2 was sitting there stone-faced and/or sleeping. Group #3 was occasionally giggling. I was in group #2. The music sucked, the acting was horrible, and the only time I laughed was during the religious talk they had. And throughout the whole freakin' movie, George Clooney looked like he was about to puke from being chained to John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Their presence might well have been what ruined the movie for me. Please, everyone, for the sake of your sanity and bank accounts, do not buy/rent/think about watching this movie.

The isolated moments of wit (Such as the "When In Rome..." confusion) are drowned-out in the all-too-typical stupidity associated with most SNL alums. The raunch factor is quite high for a PG-13 movie (including one particular sight gag that was completely unfunny) and there is not a single likable character in the entire movie. It competely lost me when the kicked the dog off of the bridge. Mean-spirited, uncreative, and mindless--Anchorman needs to be cancelled from the realm of cinema altogether.'

When I went to the movie, I thought she was gonna be running for office - that I think woulda been a better story idea, where she's in the next phase of her life, tackling obstacles and fighting battles at the next level of tests in maturity. But no, they basically did a repeat of the first one, where she goes to a new place where her sorority-mad perkiness is scoffed at and eventually accepted through her hard work and good-heartedness. In a word, it was lame."

Bill Paxton is one of the first faces you see, and although he seems to have some gifts of late in directing his own films, he is a TERRIBLE actor. I could see no reason at all why an ancient old lady would take a helicopter ride out to the site of the wreck in order to tell her story. What, don't you have a TELEPHONE? The story takes place in 1996 after all. Leo Dicaprio is not a bad actor really, but the love story was the usual claptrap out of the Hollywood script bin, and was completely unrealistic. How the hell this won best picture is beyond my comprehension. James Cameron's The Abyss and the original Terminator had more compelling characters and better presented love stories, frankly. Dances with Wolves (another overrated best picture) was a better film than Titanic, but I honestly think they both won best pic only bacause audiences were surprised at themselves for being able to sit thru 3+ hours of film."

S'Rarely have I seen a film that was more boring or held my interest less than this poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It certainly did not even begin to utilize the abilities or approach the usual standards of the cast involved. The most glaringly apparent problem was the misuse of the considerable comedic talents of Billy Crystal. He barely had anything to do or say and what he did say was far below par on the humor/wit/taste scale. In particular, the scene with the dog had the distinction of sinking even below the standards of a junior high school boy s locker room. Julia Roberts, cast as Catherine Zeta-Jone s mistreated sister/personal assistant, did manage not to scream and giggle every ten minutes, had a few good lines but her overall character was poorly written and pretty unbelievable. After seeing even a small bit of the insulting treatment she continuously receives from her completely self-centered movie star sister you can t imagine what would have kept her from smacking her silly long before this point in their lives. So, it made no sense that this woman would suddenly grow teeth and fight back after an apparent lifetime of accepting abuse simply because she was now involved with her sister s ex (John Cusack). Overall, I m not sure what portion of this movie made it not work most poor writing, directing, or just an unfocused murky concept. But one thing I do know, considering the many past successes, efforts, and combined talents of the cast I give them little, if any, of the blame for the failure of this film. They simply had very little with which to work.'

S"I thought that Meet the Parents was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I didn't care about the characters at all. We never got to fully understand Ben his fiance's relationship, therefore not caring whether they got through this obstacle of meeting her parents. It wasn't funny. I was so bored and annoyed with the movie, I was actually looking away from the screen. I understand how nerve racking it is meeting significant others parents, but this was just too ridiculous. I do have a sense of humor and I do like stupid entertaining movies but this was just stupid. I thought it was horrible. The movie was so predictable so it took away from the funny parts since you knew what was coming up. I thought Ben Stiller was good. His fiance was not. Robert DeNiro used to be great, he was okay in this movie. This movie just rubbed me the wrong way and I ended up walking out with 15 minutes left. Didn't I want to see whether they get back together? Well, no. I didn't care at all. I also knew that they would since the movie was so predictable. I thought about it after I walked out to see if I was too harsh....but I really didn't like the movie."

S"t3 was a joke. Did they writers even watch the first two movies?? They butchered the storyline, and ruined the trilogy. The previous movies were serious, with some comedy...this was a comedy with bad graphics. Graphics are suppose to make things LOOK more real, not totally abstract. (see T2 idiots) I think T2 graphics were much better....and the sound....bad sound....what happened to NO FATE BUT WHAT WE MAKE....the future isn't written???? then why the hell does J Conner have a solemate. What a joke. This isn't another stupid chosen one movie, where the he is destined to glory, he just happens to be the one who saves the day in the end. He isn't a jesus figure....writters took stuff from the Matrix storyline and thrusted it into a much more complex story. T1 and T2 had a story, a good story, with significant action scenes and a plot. YES, PLOT. The amount of crap that was shoved into T3 complicated the movie, I don't even know exactly what happened. People don't need none stop action, T2 fans liked the story, not just effects. AND, the effects were actually good, not a joke. I still don't know how SKYNET was built despite the work of Dyson In short, T3 was a comedy, with no story, no acting, no sound , and no legitimate connection to the previous movies. I have so much respect for James Cameron that I never knew."

The story is undeveloped, as are the characters, and the plot goes nowhere. This film's special effects are definitly below average, and the film's low budget shows through in every scene. I would ask Kurt Russell if he read the script before making this, or if they just through a good heap of money at him. This is even beneath his abilities as an actor."

If you were unfortunate enough to see the movie House of The Dead, I think Club Dread was at least partially making fun of this movie. Given, it's supposed to be cheesy and bad, but it wasn't so bad it was funny, it was just bad.

However, it wasn't scary or suspensful and was actually very stupid. Dracula in New Orleans, please. It is no wonder most of the actors in this film havent' worked since this disaster. "

But I feel the need to do my civic duty and warn people who are thinking about renting this movie: DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE! If you ever find yourself wanting to rent this movie, have a friend hog-tie you until you come to your senses. Really - this movie is awful. And it's not even awful in a funny way - it's awful in a boring, overly dramatic way. What was Tom Cruise thinking? His character (along with all the others) is just not likeable - nor is he unlikeable in a love to hate way. It's hard to enjoy a movie when you can't empathize with any of the characters. Poor Kubrick. How can the director of Clockwork Orange deteriorate so much? With a proper story and decent directing, the acting might have been OK. But Cruise and Kidman had nothing to work with. They put their faith in Kubrick, and he laid an egg on them."

S"I can't give this movie more than 1 star because while I'm glad I saw it once, just so I could say I saw it, I wouldn't want to sit through it again. The whole premise of the movie was stupid to me: I thought it was overstyled and way too ostentatious (tried way too hard to be cool). Examples include those stupid gloves that the agents would wear when they were going through the electronic files, waving their arms dramatically in the air. Lame. Why not just have a futuristic mouse pointer? Or just one glove? Because Spielberg had to make it dramatic and make it look cool. Would've been way cooler if you didn't need gloves to operate the thing, or, better yet, if you didn't even have to move to operate it. On another note, keeping the three psychic folks floating in a pool of ectoplasmic milk was just too hokey to be believed. Also, I think there were some scenes in the movie that Spielberg made gratuitously gross just so the movie got under your skin . But I didn't pay $7.50 to see spraying vomit, bloody eyeballs and rotten sandwiches. I paid to see a cool, futuristic, thought-provoking movie. And I sure as hell didn't get what I paid for. Apparently, since Stanley Kubrick died, Steven Spielberg has been suffering from delusions that he's Kubrick reincarnated. I wish some of his inner circle would pull him aside and tell him that we don't need another Kubrick, or, at the very least, if he's going to try to mimic Kubrick in his movies he needs to avoid the gross-out factor - a movie can be dark, funny and disturbing without the gratuitous vomit shots."

Swayze, a clubfooted hoofer in need of acting lessions and pinchfaced little trollop Jennifer Grey, nice body, honker and all. The best thing about this turkey is the fact that it takes place in the Borscht Belt, oy vey, which harkens back to childhood memories in my long-distant past. Even the dancing, the supposed strong suit of this attempt at making a movie, was predictable and hardly impressive. What would have made this a better movie is if Grey did about fifteen nude scenes: this would have kept me from nodding off every five minutes or so. Cousin Brucie Morrow's favorite flick, and that tells you plenty."

I was interested at first because of the sweet honest romance Kinsey and his wife shared and their naivity about sex. It was cute. But the remainder of the movie took a beautiful thing and shat (is that a word?) all over it. My image of Lliam Neeson is forever ruined. '

I thought his acting was horrible - he seemed to be about as competent as a 7th grader putting on a middle school play. The storyline was pathetic if you ask me. Everything happens way too fast, it's as if nothing develops. Jango Fett's involvement in this movie seems unecessary to me as well. There's a lot of action but aside from Yoda's lightsaber scene, none of it was nearly as good as it could've been. The Clone Wars is a really cool concept that could've made a great movie, but as with the Phantom Menace, Lucas really mucked it up."

S'Basically we have "The Exorcist" meets "Rosemary\'s Baby". If you enjoy special effects at the expense of character development and plot, by all means - indulge yourself. Personally, I found this about as interesting as a trip through a meat packing plant on a golf cart going 120 miles per as I\'m paging through a comic book of the Gospels according to the mentally deranged. But, I won\'t go there since there isn\'t enough space on this page to cover the pathetic use and abuse of theology. I\'ll just sum up by saying; not funny, not frightening - just near sited, ill informed and very, very dumb. I\'ll hand it to Reeves though; he apparently stays on top of the acting game just enough to get first choice at the high budget glitz - wherein his only requirement is to storm around like a male model with an inflamed hemorrhoid spouting what might pass as witty one liners - provided you are still in high school. It would appear that the formula is; throw in enough special effects as camouflage and anyone can look like an actor. Sadly, and for reasons I can no longer remember, I gave him a bit more credit than that. Up until now.'

He plays this man who needs to deal with the inevitable circumstancs of age and retirement which suddenly befall him. Suddenly, he needs to find his way in a life that has become routine and taken for granted. It is sad and at the same time, comic, to see him stumble around in his new shoes. But the rest of the comedy depends on whether or not you're from the country and can roll with the punches. These country characters are over-the-top schlocky. If all else fails, Kathy Bates hot tub debut is fun. Hilarious at times, sad, ultimately uplifting, About Schmidt is a sweet ride."

S"Worth seeing. The Enron story is an unbelievable story of greed - not just by the Skillings and Lays, but by their bankers, lawyers, accountants, customers, investors, and traders. There was so much cash being thrown off by the stock's meteoric rise, that everybody involved was content to take their place at the trough, and ignore their ethics. I was blown away by the price California paid for Enron's greed. Having lived through the rolling blackouts a couple of years ago, I had always found it extremely strange that the State would suddenly run out of power, especially in the winter. Well it turns out, a desperate Enron was driving its traders to convince power station operators to shut down, in order to drive the price of electricity up. Enron would profit from the increased prices, and more lucratively, gamble that the price of electricity would go up. These profits allowed Enron to maintain the facade of a financially healthy company. In California, businesses were being shut down, cars were crashing when streetlights went down, and the fifth largest economy in the world would be crippled for hours on end. And all so Enron could line their pockets. Governor Gray Davis plead to the Feds for help in regulating the price of energy. Unfortunately for California, George W. Bush is/was a close family friend of Lay, and even was recorded taping a birthday video for Skilling, and no help was forthcoming. (to be fair, the Fed position was that this was a California issue, but the obvious conflict of interest made my stomach turn.) Stunning sequences in this movie of Gray Davis questioning how half the states power plants could be down for maintenance at the same time, set against taped Enron trader calls to the power plants, saying that they need to find a reason to shut down for a little while. It's an ugly story, and tragic as well - the movie begins and ends with the suicide of one of Enron's beloved executives, not to mention the galling video clip of a laughing Skilling imploring his employees to put their entire 401K's in Enron stock. While the movie is a little heavy handed, it makes for compelling viewing. "

Instead of constantly persecuting these people, maybe it\'s time to try and understand them. I think this movie is a small step in the right direction. I think all the "Brokebutt" comments are so juvenile and ignorant. People need to grow-up. Maybe it\'s time we focus on more pressing issues that are really affecting society.

Though it was PG, there was nothing really objectionable other than they said the word Crap now and then. The movie, kind of a dead-panned Revenge of the Nerds meets Judy Blume set in an Idaho High School, it was surprisingly funny (my wife was in extreme stitiches). Napoleon (played brilliantly by Jon Heder) was hilarious. In fact, each character is delightfully absurd in their own way. I got a kick out of Dietrich Bader (Otto from the Drew Carey Show); he was my favorite as the wacko Sensei, Rex, who taught the lost martial art of Rex Kwon DO. Though I find most Indie films pretentious and way overhyped, not so with Napoleon Dynamite. It's an excellent film."

S'Concur with Seraph. This is one of the better suspense movies I\'ve seen in a while. I\'ll cite a few reasons why I liked this movie: 1) A very good plot. It\'s got all that New Orleans\' Hoodoo/Voodoo interacial gobbledygook which is always good for a scare (Much more effective than the Lamo "Haunted Mansion" Disney offering). They do a great job in tricking the viewer into thinking who the "whodunit" is; but no one suspects what really transpires in the very creative ending. 2) Great locales. Pre-Katrina New Orleans and neighboring Terrebonne Parish are depicted. Even before the hurricanes hit, you get the idea that this is a part of the country where you are better off having gills and an umbrella strapped to your head. I recall on a Charleston SC Ghost Walk, the tour guide commenting Charleston ranks a distant second to New Orleans in ghost sightings. One look at this movie and I\'m reminded of Dan Aykroyd\'s comment, "We\'re in Ghost Central Station." It is one of the more effective uses of location to create a haunting mood since Philadelphia and "The Sixth Sense." 3) Kate Hudson is hot and a pretty good actress to boot(y). You\'ll get to see her in a few panty-clad scenes, tight-jeans scenes, and a Damsel-in-Distress scene. '

S"Fantastic film. I read the book years before I had seen the film (I recently purchased it). Of course it doesn't totally follow the book, but they usually have to be slightly adapted for the large screen. Jack Nicholson has such an enormous screen prescence and always seems to be a down and out rebel. Danny Devito was really good as Martini (I didn't realise it was him because he was smiling). Christopher Lloyd was brilliant as well. The Nurse wasn't quite as I expected (after all, she was supposed to be top heavy). But other wise it was fantastic. The man who played Billy was really moving and did the stutter really well (If you want to see him in something else, watch the X-Files espisode called 'Beyond The Sea', he's the prisoner who has visions. Definately deserving of 5 stars."

I was surprised when they said the Shawshank Redemption. Me, like a movie about prison? I was sure they must be mistaken. Well I rented it and loved it. Tim Robbins,was great as the man who was wrongly accused of a double murder. He ended up in prison for decades. Morgan Freeman was also good as a fellow prisoner.I was expecting a movie about lots of violence and was surprised to find out it was more about how tim Robbins character survived his decades in prison and his victory in the end.A bit too long but a great movie.'

I had just finished reading the novel and immediately had to see the movie. the reality of it makes you sick to your stomach, but the reality keeps you from turning away. Marlon Wayans perfomed astoundingly well, a major turn from his somewhat comical roles he normally assumes. Ellen Burstyn's performance brought me to tears.

S"The 15 minute journey into hell that was featured as the American forces stormed the beach at Normandy was perhaps the most riviting and horrifyingly true to life cinema that has ever been created. The audience is right in there amongst the carnage as bodies are being torn apart and young lives are lost in the most unnatural ways. I don't see any politics being played out here, just stark, naked reality. Although the actual occurrences of DDay outstripped these terrible scenes a thousandfold, from the accounts of surviving soldiers who were there, the film comes closer than any of it's predecessors. The story is secondary to the horrors lived out on screen and Spielberg outdoes himself as a director of visuals. The progression of this great director's career has been amazing. As his budgets rise, his films seem to grow exponentially."

S"What a great movie! I thought Sissy Spacek and Hugh Wilkinson should have gotten Best Actress and Best Actor Oscars respectively, but of course the people I like never win. Hugh Wilkinson does a particlularly understated and masterful job as Sissy Spacek's husband, and film buffs might be interested to know that this amazing actor actually hails from Yorkshire, England and was in the hugely funny Full Monty. He's anything but funny in this heart-wrenching drama about a family that is devastated by the son's affair with an older woman and the catastrophic results. Sissy Spacek deserves kudos as the normally strong mother who simply cannot deal with the death of her son. This movie makes some sharp comments about America's justice system, too. Their son's murderer gets off lightly and Sissy Spacek has to endure the agony of running into him at the local grocery store. The murderer can only manage a feeble hi. Sissy Spacek's and Hugh Wilkinson's solution to this dilemma is shocking and unconventional, but one can certainly understand it. However, this movie will definitely not leave you smiling from ear to ear. Rent it if you're depressed and in the mood for a good cry."

Douglas, Maguire, McDormand and Downey Jr. all did an amazing job in forming their characters and drawing in the audience. I disagree with Molfan, I found this film very humorous..maybe because I enjoy dark, dry humor..You couldn't help but laugh at the comedic tragedy of this weekend in the life of this group of people. I am not for killing dogs..but the whole scenario was humorous in a sick way..I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone. As for the ending..I enjoyed the fact that they gave some closure..however, in sticking with the unpredictable plot, they could have ended with him wavering at the top of the stairs..keep you wondering..of course, that may have irritated a lot of people..thus the nice happy ending.

S'As with most Reese Witherspoon flicks, the key word is cute. This movie was a pleasant surprise. The actors were all talented that charmed you. The typical, sweet story of country girl goes to the big city, lost love and having to choose between the two worlds. Predictable but the joy of it is that you want it to happen predictably...with the happy ending.'

S"What a great movie. I didn't see Shawshank Redemption in the theater, and nobody ever recommended it to me. So when I rented it one night I had low expectations, and it surprised me quite a bit when the movie easily jumped into my all-time top 10 list. The story and the acting are both excellent. But I think the thing that pushes this movie to the next level is the way it inspires you without being sappy, without resorting to the typical ham-handed techniques movies use to play on your emotions. Shawshank isn't fancy - it just tells a powerful story in a way that makes you really care about the characters. And laced into that is this great message about freedom and the power of hope. See - it's hard to even write power of hope without cringing, so imagine how tough it must be to make a great movie about it without crossing the line into sap. Well, regardless of how it accomplishes that feat, this movie is a must-see."

S'This film could quit possibly one of the most brilliant motion pictures ever made. No movie has ever made me feel the way this one did. I read the book over a year ago and this is one of the best book adaptions ever. Director Aronofsky is the next Stanley Kubrik. I cannot get over the performances ,the visuals,the score out of my head since I saw it. This film will stick with me forever. Beautiful,dark,scary,depressing and brilliant.Can you smell the Oscars? Mmmmmm...Oh and buy the way if you are seeing this movie just because you might have a chance to see T and A DO NOT GO SEE IT. Not only is there none but this movie is not about sex. It is about love, more specifically love gone wrong. NC-17 does not nesacarily mean nudity. Requien is a highly disturbing beauty of a film and if you are the T and A type who goes to a movie just so they can go home later and masturbate over the pair of breasts you saw instead of seeing it for the brilliant film it is Do NOT GO! You can still love someone and make the wrong choices. We love ourselves as much as we love others. And when an addiction becomes so strong it destroys the emotions and the caring you have toward the ones you love that is love gone wrong.Yes it is about addiction and the depths of depravity people go to get their fix. Sex is in no way a key subject in this film.Yes sex is within the film,yes there is a little nudity, yes there is a graphic sex scene but this is just a means for getting the point of the film accros.Sex as a part in this film is just a side note. If such a deep and thought provoking film disapointed you for the lack of sex and nudity you need to step out of the SHALLOW kiddie pool and step into the BIG KIDS POOL.Sometimes there is more to life than sex. Like meaning. Just a thought.'

S"Based on the book of the same title by James Ellroy (Very good author and if you like the film you should read the Dudley Smith Trio book) It carries off the style of Hollywood 1950's very well and the cast is amazing. Yes, the story is slow, but its meant to be. If you want a fast, simple film with loads of action then go and watch some of the s**t action films that Hollywood now spews out. This is a film thats meant to challenge you, make you think. Kevin Spacey is as magnificent as ever. If you liked him in 'The Usual Suspects' you'll definately like him in this. Russell Crowe plays a character that actually has some depth and shows off his acting abilities and Kim Basinger is absolutely stunning as the Veronica Lake look-alike (and she actually does look like her) but also shows that she can act - I'd say that this is her best film. Guy Pearce is outstanding and I'd say this is another film of his to be added to the list where he shows that Neighbours is way behind him now. This film is full of suspense, twists, sub plots, the corruption of the LAPD and shows the underworld of Hollywood. If you appreciate good acting and an intelligent plot, tehn this is a film for you.

His acting prior to and after saying that was just so intense and phenominal it makes me wonder why he didn't win the Oscar. Tom Cruise was also at the top of his game, and he was equally intense in the famous courtroom scene with Jack Nicholson.

Yes, drugs feel good and we shouldn't shy away from telling our kids this or they will not trust what we tell them. The message is that the costs of those good feelings are not worth it, not at all. I was also amazed at what we in America consider to be impovershed, our standards are quite high compared to Scotland! HUD housing in America would be considered luxurious there."

The heavyweight cast of Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Owen and Luke Wilson, Danny Glover, and Anjelica Huston turn in nearly perfect performances, and Wes Anderson adds the same quirky touches that made Rushmore such an outstanding film. This movie will make you laugh out loud, and may choke you up a little as well. To give you a sense how it was received in the theater where I saw it, most people applauded when it was over. The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the better movies I have seen in the last year or so."

It is emotional and depressing, but enthralling and very well done. It is most definatley a movie that you need to watch closely and pay attention to- it is deep and detailed. 5 stars without a doubt.'

S" Resevoir Dogs is Tarantino's preliminary film to the chronologically disjointed and colorfully violent film, Pulp Fiction . It had the same elements of Pulp.. without being as polished or grand. It's a smaller story with a rawer edge, but that doesn't detract from the fact that it is an exhilarating film full of sharp dialogue and intriguing situations. The particular thing that struck me about Resevoir Dogs was the special camraderie among the characters. It gave us a glimpse into the personifications of the oxymoron-'honorable criminals'. Keitel's 'Mr. White' is the foremost example of this: the second scene in the film where Mr. Orange was bleeding profusely from the gut and White was holding his hand and encouraging him to hang on was one of the most interesting and heartwrenching scenes of cinematic male-bonding without being too melodramatic or kitsch-y."

As for her dress code in this movie, I've heard from my friend that the true Erin said in Oprah that her actual dressing style is even more revealing than Robert's in the film. So, for those of you who feel offended with the sexy style, just know that the real Erin dressed even sexier than that. What's up with that, anyway? I've seen women dressed sexier than Robert in the film. Didn't you see Jennifer Lopez??"

It will make the homophobic among us quite uncomfortable, I'm sure. If you can keep an open mind and open heart, you can feel for these people deeply and care what happens to them. Brandon Teena is not portrayed as a perfect person, but as a human being with faults and with dreams and needs that are shunned by most people around him. These things do happen in real life if you choose to recognize it. This film sheds light on intolerance in a pioneering and honest way. I can't recommend it highly enough."

S"Thw best of the Quentin Tarintino trilogy and his first. This film is executed marvolously. Everything is believable, every line a character has seems real and almost immproved. Also very original to take a crime movie away from the crime that has been commited and tell the stories through series of flashbacks for every primary character and through scenes of the aftermath. No director with a right mind could ask for a better ensemble cast to bring this picture to life. Heavy hitters like Harvey Keitel,Tim Roth,Steve Buscemi(in one of his most memrobale roles) and Michael Madson really make this a unbelievably good crime drama. Filled with as much humor as action. Of course this is Tarintino humor so it is a bit morbid and crude at times. There is one line inparticular that nails me every time. When Mr.Pink keeps asking Joe why he has to be Mr.Pink and then Joe's reply puts me on the ground. A must see for any fan of Tarintino or great story telling seen through the eyes of a visionary film maker."

The story of a Russian sniper was particularly interesting to me, as was the terror and insanity of the Battle of Stalingrad. If you ever get a chance to play the Russian part of the game Call of Duty you can see how the game was modeled after this movie -- everything from the dangerous river crossing to the rationing of ammo to the shooting of those who turned back is in there.'

I was so engulfed in the movie that I hardly drank any of my drink, and in the last 30 minutes of the movie, the bottom of my cup fell out and spilled all over my lap ! But the movie was so good I sat there in the soda and finished watching it. I can say no movie has ever touched me this much to put up with that..lol. But in any event, I went to see the TITANIC the next weekend without any accidents, and I loved it the 2nd time as well. I have seen it several times since then at home, and still never get tired of it. This is one of 2 movies that I actually loved to see Leo DiCaprio star in. The first being Gilbert Grape. I still don't have any idea how he pulled it off. I also love the theme song by Celine Dion. Excellent film and soundtrack ! I recommend the movie to all families !"

The performances across the board were absolutely super. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep were both great, but it was the performance by Justin Henry (he played the kid) that was most impressive. The scenes with him and Hoffman were so memorable, particularly the one towards the end of the movie as they discuss where he will be living. If you haven't seen this film, check it out and be sure that you have some tissues."

I think the ratings showm at this website reflect this. This is a movie about life itself and about the choices that we've made and will make. Many have criticized the ending. At the end of the movie, Tom Hanks has some new choices to make. The movie does not indicate exactly what he does. This is the way that the movie HAD to end because there is a certain amount of logic to each of the different choices that he could have made. This is what fascinates me about this movie. I love to ask people which choice do you think he made. Their responses are varied an always subject to debate. I'm not a touchy-feely kind of guy ( I got my degree in Accounting and things HAVE to balance, damn it!). But Cast Away really moved me."

The book which the movie was based upon was written by piecing together letters which Shaw sent back to his New England family - and which are still on display in a Boston museum. The acting is superb - Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Matthew Broderick, the story is compelling (and true), and the drama is intense. If you have not seen this movie, brace yourself - it is sad and powerful and deep and historical.'
