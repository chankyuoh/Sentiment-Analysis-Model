S'Jeesus H. Christ, I hated this movie. It\'s been a long time since I wanted to walk out on a film within the first fifteen minutes. Wait a minute . . . no it hasn\'t. There was "The Constant Gardener". Yuck. Anyway, back to the turd in question. The storyline had one gimmick. A good premise, that went nowhere. So, the story sucked, but it wasn\'t the worst thing about this film. The worst thing about this film was the MILF. Every second she was on screen was one more second that I seriously contemplated a mad dash for the door. She was plain awful. Her overly melodramatic, shrewlike, smarmy dialouge was bad enough. I\'ll give her credit for a decent performance. It wasn\'t her fault that the casting director, film director and screenwriter sucked. She seemed to be a good actress, but I guess it\'s hard to act your way out of a bad movie. I wouldn\'t know. In fact, I don\'t know a damn thing about making movies, except that I know a bad one when I see it. Anyway, I simply didn\'t buy the idea that this movie "mom" had a sixteen year old son, a five year old daughter and hips like a seventeen year old girl. Needless to say, her makeup & hair were always perfect. Yeah, right. Major pet peeves of mine. I\'m sick of Hollywood\'s version of regular folks who look as though they stepped out of a Spiegel catalog. Seriously, the only time I enjoyed her performance was when she flashed the beaver . . . but, ummm I gotta ask, just what the hell WAS that all about? Hey, I\'m into 69\'ing cheerleaders and rough sex on the stairway, but I wasn\'t expecting to see either one in this particular movie. At least, not where the director put them, not from those angles, not for that long and not set to a "Tender Moments" soundtrack. Hot scenes, I guess, but besides being out of place they went on tooooo long. And that MUSIC. Aaaarghhhh! I mean, if I\'m watching people bump and grind I expect some bowmp-ba-bowmp or screetching guitars or Bolero or anything but that sappy Hallmark Movie of the Week, elevator music. God, this movie sucked. Just sucked. I need a drink.'

S"I couldn't agree more with the comment of Eb.b5644om . This is a very manupulative film with laughable scripts and false emotions, worst of all Julie Robert is most annoying ever! Obviously, this is the usual Robert's ugling duckling comedy sugar coated in dramatic form since it claimed itself adapted from the true story. Many people thus thought they have seen a great dramatic film. I cannot believe its popularity and critical acclaims except from Roger Ebert (check out his comment). The bad langauge is unbelievable. I doubt the real Erin could get a job in a law firm with this degree of foul mouth, rude attitude and prostitute-worn wardrobes, let alone insult the lawyers made completely idiots in the film. Remember films based on true story do not always have the right details or even story lines! "

I didn t think Jim Carey could fall any farther down on my list of actors I least like to watch but darned if he didn t manage to do just that the other night when I tried to make it through this film. Not since Ishtar have I seen such a criminal waste of celluloid. I don t mind a little mindless bathroom humor once in awhile but not when it s this blatantly mindless and appears to be the sole purpose of the movie. Renee Zellwegger must cringe when she looks back on her decision to become involved in this abortion. I would even think Carey must flinch a little and with his record that s saying a lot.'

S"'Gangs of New York' is probably one of the most disappointing films I've seen in my entire life. Epic? Lawrence of Arabia is epic. 'Gangs of New York' is just long, as far as I can tell, with a few historical sidebars thrown in here and there to flesh out an otherwise rambling and somewhat pointless story. This was a fascinating time in our history, no doubt about it. But with the facts and dates all re-arranged and the main story boiled down to a simple revenge tale... I'm just not sure what Scorsese is getting at. While the turf war theme certainly plays into our current and horrifying political situations, that alone doesn't make me feel anything for these characters. Daniel Day Lewis does a fantastic job, no question. And Leo isn't half bad either. But with a couple of terrible musical choices (ending with a U2 song? It's the 1800's, for the love of pete!) and no discernable visual style (it seems Scorsese said all he needed to say about fighting in 'Raging Bull'. You'll only get warmed over Braveheart fighting here), this movie became my least favorite of Scorsese's otherwise brilliant career."

If you saw a legit representation of the time period, it wouldn't be pretty and it wouldn't look like this phony Hollywood schlock. If you honestly find plantations, slaves, cotton, and the Civil War to be a fantastic backdrop to romance, then you need to ratchet your sense of drama down a couple notches. Not to say the leads weren't great actors (they are to make this turkey such a favorite), just that that Selznick brand of moviemaking left me wondering what the big deal was."

But this new movie version apparently is a disgrace to the play and I don't intend to see it! ):0("

You can tell the story was taken from a well written book and instead of being true to the book it was completely hollywood-ised, where half-way through we were seeing the whose who of hollywood which completely detracted from the movie. Nicole Kidman is a good actress, but this movie failed to stretch her ability or show any of her growing potential like The Hours or The Others. The accents were awful, if your getting paid $15 million for a movie the least you could do is show some respect to the audiences intelligence and do a convincing southern accent.'

This movie is made for people who like crap like Godzilla(America's Mathew Broderick version),Dante's Peak and Deep Blue Sea. All show and no blow.

It is a self-indulgent, vague, badly-acted piece of tripe that in no way deserved the preamble and hype that it got. Casting Cruise and Kidman together was perhaps it's biggest downfall... the two of them seem to spend most of the time trying to out-act each other, and Cruise is patently uncomfortable throughout. It's almost as though the team who put it together sat down and thought of the most likely ingredients for a big audience hey - Kubrick, Cruise, Kidman, 3 hours long, artfully vague plot - Let's do it! (No thank YOU!) Eyes Wide Shut has the dubious honour of being the ONLY movie I have ever walked out of. Oh I tried. God knows I tried.

Just that alone kills all credibility of the plot and makes the movie terrible. Also, the whole divine intervention, man angry at God, etc just doesn't go with an alien invasion subplot. It was not the least bit scary...well I was scared that if I died on the way home, this movie would be the last thought on my mind. Perhaps I was expecting the same quality as in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I guess I was wrong. This director didn't even come close. There were so many little tangents he went out on and didn't even attempt to tie them together. The characters had no development and were inconistant. The wife could see things as she was gonna die, but couldn't see that she was gonna die. There was no surprise ending and the aliens looked like atheletes in body paint. Also, when the embattled earth was dealing with the invasion, which was killing thousands of people, why would the media wait until after the commercial to announce the primative miracle weapon ?

There's 2 sequences you can laugh at though. One is on the plane there, where Sam Neill dreams that a raptor is talking to him. A second is when they find the cellphone in a huge pile of dinosaur turds, and suddenly a ceratosaur runs up and JUST looks at them before ambling off. Otherwise, it's awful."

Too much talking and angry screaming...not to mention the over-use of the F-Word ...I mean, cussing is okay, to some extent, but when you hear it used every other word in a movie it gets tiresome. The whole witch thing seemed very unrealistic. I couldn't buy the idea that a witch was following the group, but the events that happened to the group seemed more like the work of local pranksters, which made the movie very, very un-scary. The ending was terrible. It was confusing and left me with a feeling of unsatisfaction. And the stupid camera movement makes you really sick to your stomach. It gave me a headache after a while.

It basically had no storyline, just little snippets into the lives of porn actors, not even interesting pieces at that. After it came out there was talk about Burt Reynolds winning a Best Supporting actor for his part? LOL What did he have? maybe 20 lines?

WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. I don't give a damn about a stupid love story! That isn't what Pearl Harbor was about! I care about the history not the stupid friggin love triangle thing! If I wanted that mellow Drama BULL Sh*t I would have gone and seen HERE ON EARTH or some other teeny bopper crap movie with a love triangle in it. Stupid side plots like that have no porpous in what could have been a very fine war drama about America and one of its greatest loses and most horrible disasters. This film should have been titled Pearl Harbor's All That or Sleepless in Pearl Harbor. This movie is a travesty and I am ashamed for ever going to see this peice of trash. What complete poo."

Johnny Depp's acting was horrendous and campy (even when one considers that he pretty much did everything with his part that he could.)and it seemed almost as painful for him to say those bland, terrible lines as it was for me to listen to them. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a horse beaten to death..why can't we just let it rest in peace? What really rubs me the wrong way,though, is that Tim Burton directed this film. You don't make a masterpiece like the Nightmare Before Christmas and then do..whatever the hell this was. If you want to fully experience said tale then read the book by Washington Irving. Please don't see this movie Oh, and Christopher, honey... why? no, really, why would you do that to yourself?..."

S'This is my favorite movie of all time. I own the DVD and have watched it maybe 25 times. My family laughs and makes fun on me when I watch it. I ve never really been able to determine what draws me to it. I have noticed that there are no women characters in the movie other than incidental (the opening scenes where his wife is shown, some of the jury, the last parole board has a representative, the board house woman and the grocery store), thus all the interaction of any substance is between men. This is not what I usually watch. Somehow the isolation and introspection by the characters seems important. I usually have plot criticisms of movies such as when characters do things that are nonsensical, something requires 1000-to-one odds to work and works, or cars roll over and there is a small nuclear detonation to enhance a scene. But the plot in SR is flawless. I ll read some more of the reviews.'

It basically follows the arrest (on questionable evidence) and trial of three teenagers in West Memphis, Arkansas for the horrific mutilation murder of three young boys. If you're from the deep south you might be offended by all the obvious stereotypes.. although none of them in this film are created for effect. This is life as it really is for the people in question. Rusting trailer parks peopled by folks on welfare wearing trucker hats. The ubiquitous cigarette butt hanging from their lips. Their sad smiles revealing missing teeth. You feel for these people embroiled in something beyond their limited ability to comprehend. A moving and powerful movie."

S"If the original is arguably the greatest film ever, 'The Godfather, Part II' is also definitely among the very best films ever put on the silver screen. Who can weave two stories together as well as Francis Ford Coppola? No one can. And if there is one thing that might make it stand out from the original film, it is the even greater acting on display. With respect to Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Lee Strasberg, and Michael Gazzo, I really don't think John Cazale as Fredo Corleone gets enough credit. Cazale gives the performance of a lifetime as the runt of a family of lions. The bottom line is that 'II' is every bit as ferocious and probably more cunning a film than the original. Standing by itself in moviedom, however, it sits Janus-faced in its historical importance, as generations of moviegoers are awed."

Beneath the pure entertainment value of its interesting story and incredibly brilliant performance by Robin Williams, this film tells much about the soul's desire in choice of vocation versus just trying to do what's expected of us by authority figures such as parents and heads of prestigious schools. On another level I think it encourages the passion of books, poetry and reading. Besides Williams, all the other roles in the film were also well acted, and the students all seemed very real. "

To me, the message was that a person with good intentions can have a positive, important impact on whatever environment in which he finds himself - no matter how hopeless or unfair that environment is. Andy Dufresne touched everyone who he came in contact with, and many with whom he did not. And in the end, he was made the life for himself which he wanted. A powerful film.'

S"A labour of love for Kevin Spacey. The film hops between the genres of bio-pic and musical, with flashbacks into the subconscious of the main character in a way that is a little scattered. But I don't think it harms the telling of a good story or the examination of the character of the driven and charismatic Bobby Darin. And Kevin Spacey looks like he is having a pure ball when he's singing Darin's songs."

S'There is no doubt that this will be a classic. "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" is a solid representation of C.S. Lewis\'s world; there are few tweaks in the storyline (the beginning of the story, mostly, but the more realistic approach is appreciated in the real world portion of the movie), but it is mostly quite faithful to the novel. SYNOPSIS: . . . I wont get into it, you probably have already read it. PROS: Only with this level of computer technology could we get such a rich and fluid world that does the imagination justice (and for those critics who are sticking their nose up in the air and saying that "well, my imagination was far better", I\'d wager to say that if we put your glorious imagined version on screen, most people would highly disagree; in short, "stow it"). As mentioned before, there was little done to stray from the novel (there are three or four notable exceptions, but they do not detract from the movie). The children did an admirable job portraying Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Georgie Henley (Lucy) was particularly impressive, and I think shed give Dakota Fanning a run for her money. The non-human characters were well rendered. The great battle, though somewhat brief, was great. The soundtrack was beautiful. The two hour and twelve minute running time passes as quickly as does the time in the real world compared to that in Narnia. CONS: They could have certainly done more with Aslan; it was easy for me to forgive, though, since most people would be bringing their children to see this, and kids in the theater had a difficult time sitting through two hours as it was. I hope that, once released on DVD, it might involve Aslan more. Only once did I feel that the CG failed. And Im still trying to figure out why that cat in the end (during the coronation scene) had a mustache and eyeglasses clearly drawn on him, like some prankster went in with the Microsoft Paint program and hand-drawn eyeglasses and the mustache. Maybe it was some bizarre inside joke, but it totally distracted me from the movie. OVERALL: Definitely worth seeing, definitely worth buying on DVD. '

Its basically the life story of Jake LaMotta's life in regards to boxing and his relationships. The fight scenes in this are magnificent and I don't know how people can rate Rocky as better than this. This film doesn't sensationalise Jake's life, it shows him hitting his young wife, lashing out at his brother, being jealous of other men looking at his wife and him putting on weight. The storyline is as intense as the fighting scenes. I'm not a fan of boxing, but I'll happily sit down and watch this movie. "

I think the blandness of Ryders character in the movie was meant to be that way in order to compliment Jolies wildness. Of course it was a little different than the book. Movies aren't as clear because they're not so black and white as books. That's the coolest part about the movie. We can see it differently. I don't believe these girls were as crazy as they wanted us to believe they were.I think more that they were just women who didn't want to follow the rules of the outside world. Maybe even the outside world would like to be as carefree as these women are sometimes but, we're afraid people will think we're crazy. I give the movie a 5 star rating because it's as realistic and crazy as this world we're living in. "

Fantastic Four, The Incredibles, Shrek 2, Sky Captain and the World of Tommorow, Spider-Man 2, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith and now Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit! Based on the three very amusing (especially "The Wrong Trousers") shorts from Aardman Animation, this british-originated claymation feature hits all the right notes. As many others have said, Gromit steals the show--without saying a word. His expressions say it all. The plot is quite humorous, and although menacing, not excessivly dark. The sense of humor that the movie has is great with awesome puns, great sight gags, some moments that nearly break the fourth wall, and even some mild double entendres. The animation is good, and some of the character designs are exteremely appealing. Overall, this was a throughly enjoyable film! '

I remember seeing the movie in the theaters with my folks and sister when I was a kid and I loved it then and still do. So many big name actors got their 'start' in this movie. Plot line is how the Japanese are trying to find Hollywood to bomb it in the year of 1941. Great comedy. Slim Pickens has a great role in this movie (short one, but great). 'Delicious, nutritious carmel coated popper snacks!!!' I am not the biggest fan of Ferris wheels to this day because of a particular scene in the movie. 'See this grapefruit? I think it's rotten. Yep, it's rotten I'm going to throw it. It's going, it's going, it's going, it's going, it's going....it's gone'. I cannot tell you how many girls a buddy of mine and myself annoyed in college at parties and bars when we would shake imaginary grapefruits and recite that line. I guess this review does not give too much insight into the movie, just shows that this was one of those movies that happened to be a favorite of mine for a particular period of time. I am not sure what other people think about it, but just thinking about it now makes me want to go and rent it tonight."

High School sports can make or break young people but these two coaches in these two movies helped make responsible adults out of their athletes. What made Hoosiers even better was Dennis Hoppers performance. Hackman's character not only made men out of boys, but inspired a man to be a man too!"

S"I saw this movie over the weekend and I thought it was thought provoking but very disturbing at the same time. Im interested in finding out what Americans think about the film & Bush after they see it, because I don't understand why they ever liked him in the first place. The guys a loser, it's shows how he has always been a failure. He wouldn't have won the election, if he didnt cheat his way in. His previous work experience, consists of working for Oil companies (go figure), which he proceded to run into the ground, if it weren't for his daddy (His money, the money the saudi's have been giving his dad for years...um the account shared with the Bin Laden's), he'd be nobody. But this movie isn't just about Bush. There are alot of other topics presented....The fact that nowadays, strangers and/or foreigners, are expendable as human beings. A phrase like Who cares, I dont know them after saying or doing something you would feel bad about doing to someone you knew/or cared about. Too many people couldn't care less about other people & find it hard to trust anyone. Too many people try to find the differences between people before realising that they have plenty of things in common. Or how being greedy for money & oil is more important than the lives of the solider's Bush sends overseas. The Bush families shared bank accounts with the Bin Laden family....How on Sept. 11, they flew 130 members of the Bin Laden family out of the states, while all other planes were grounded, instead of investigating/asking them any questions to see if they were involved.(Any innocent persons would have welcomed the questions, if they knew it would help) or how bout the young boys/girls(early 20 yr olds) that think it's cool that they can play their cd's in the tanks, while killing (most of the time) innocent people. How they were disapointed when they realised that going into the army, wasn't like a video game. I mean, any intelligent person, would find these comments scary...This is the way alot of Americans think. (This is a problem)(Watch Micheal Moore's previous movie & tell me there isn't a problem with guns in America...Anyways) These are human beings, real lives....It's very disturbing to think that they don't see anything wrong when harming someone. Every human has a family, everyone has parents & siblings. Everyone has someone they love, and more people should take a walk in each other's shoes. I don't know any of you, but I sure as hell, wouldn't see you as my enemy. and another topic, Controlled bombing in Iraq...HAH, This movie shows that it's not controlled, you see babies that have been killed by the Americans bombs & rockets, reports of alot of American solider's who not only die, but come back with missing limbs (who hears their stories on tv?) I could go on & on, But for anyone on here who makes a decision on the film, without seeing it, is either young & we'll forgive you for being naive, or you're someone who would probally die for Bush, & with his gratitude, he'd probally give your widow half of what he/she deserves. He's done that to a hell of alot of young solider's he has sent to fight his war, solider's with children....wow, he's a great president. "

S'Saving Private Ryan was the greatest war movie. Steven Spielberg has outdone himself . This is one terrific film. Spielberg makes you feel the chaos of war, and let you know how it was. The filmis unforgettable especially the first 30 minutes, where they renact D-day. That was the most realistic combat scene ever. That scene redefined the phrase WAR IS HELL!!! With the images of soldier lying on the ground with spilled intestines, a soldier losing his arm, and picking it up, another soldier getting his leg blown off. The movie also had a moving story line with Tom Hanks leading his squad of seven soldiers to go behind enemy lines and save James Ryan, the only survivor of 4 brothers who were fighting in the war. If you have not seen this movie yet, you need to. It is a great film, and it is destined to become a classic.'

The idea of the 10-year-old Kevin McCallister outsmarting everyone he encounters is hilarious. One of my favorite moments is when he manipulates the movie in his hotel room to sound like it's talking to the workers at the Plaza Hotel. The schemes he devises to trick Harry and Marv are also extremely amusing. Overall, an indescribably comical movie."

Watch out for a cops ear, Mr. Blonde and a knife, this film was great. After the opening sequence in a bar it took me to a sickening sight of Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), and Mr. White (Harvey Kietel), in a car, Orange shot in the gut and White trying to comfort him while driving a car, this is entertaining as they get. Cool. Slick. Awesome. Three words that describe Tarantino's debut. Not quite as good as Pulp Fiction, but still damn good. See now. Summary: AN EXCELLENT, COOL THRILLER THAT IS A MUST-SEE. "

The direction, script, acting and music were done so well that the emotional bang that hits you in the end is almost too much to bear. It was done so well that I was as close as I have ever been to walking out of the theatre because of the feeling the movie gave me. When the movie starts to spiral into the darkness that is the character's lives, you clench your fists together and pray for some glint of hope. The second time you watch Requiem for a Dream, you notice how beautiful the character's lives were at the beginning, and how the this time around its less disturbing and all around more depressing.

Did you know Kathy Bates has a beautiful voice? I was shocked! She adores a British singer played by Jonathan Pryce. Just as she is about to get tickets to see her idol in person, her husband (Dan Aykroyd) gives her the news that he wants a divorce. This film is part musical, mostly comedy, part mystery and drama. It takes Fox's death to teach Grace (Kathy) how to to live: A life lived in fear isn't much fun. Grace's love is unusual because she gives it without demands. She accepted her daughter-in-law, who is a dwarf and named Grace's only grandchild Pokey. Grace never condemns and still loves everyone. This is a quirky, bizarre, very funny comedy. Grace eventually learns that there is more to life than being safe. We are prompted at the end to love unconditionally our family and friends, plus ourselves. That takes courage, but this film makes it work. The songs are fabulous and you can't help but keep singing them after the movie is over. Special guest cameo by Julie Andrews is another treat; she plays herself and sings too. There are many other cameos, like Barry Manilow and Lynn Redgrave. Highly recommend you go rent this movie today!!"

A very dismaying and heartbreaking expose of the remorseless and uncaring nature of corporate decision making, and the failure of those supposedly in charge in the auto industry to protect their companies, their workers and the towns they operated in for the sake of the bottomline. Just shows you that it doesn't take much in the way of brains to make money, and that short-sightedness and greed in the so-called minds of our corporate leadership usually results in killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. What was truly reprehensible in this film was the absolute arrogance and self-centered attitudes of the putative leaders of town and industry. These money-grubbing scumbags should have bones rammed up their collective butts so the dogs can drag them through the streets."

For some reason, the saddest part for me was not the dramatic battle sequences, nor the ending in which practically every character is killed. It's the part where the graves are shown in Normandy, perfect crosses stretching as far as the eye can see. They all sacrificed so much, and that was what made me cry."

Who cares if Wyonna Ryder was in the movie, the fact that someone played the role of Susanna Kaysen..was all that mattered...and that she was evaluated and treated... Susanna was one of the lucky ones... she could be helped and she could go on to live a normal healthy life until some of the others,,,,We must never critized that which we do not understand... Mental Illness happens everyday... and we do not have the right to make light of it.. instead we should perhaps take a closer look and try to understand the plight of those trapped inside themselves...'
