S"This is NOT a documentary at all. Its Moore's distorted facts, half truths, and lies that is all jumbled into one big disasterous propaganda piece. And its not because I just don't like him. the movie jumps all over the place, from one issue to the next. It was poorly put together, and does a poor job of linking Bush to Saudi Arabia and Saddam. He only allowed soldeirs who were against the war to speak out. He also said that only one Congressman had a family member in Iraq, which is a LIE. There are actually 4 of them. How can anyone take this crap seriously? Every time he tries to get serious, he quickly ruins it with cheap shots and jokes at Bush. Like Bush's bad looks or his poor speech. What mature, fair documentary does that? The notion is given that all soldiers are against war, and that only conservatives supported it. He never once mentions who several liberals, including Mr. Kerry voted for military action and for the Patriot Act on several occassions. He mainly just reinstitutes information that has already been told by everyone else. I learned nothing new from watching this. Nothing. Instead of trying to make me support Kerry, (which is the entire point of this film) he has only managed to make me support the President even more. The opening is the worst part of the movie. He tries saying how Al Gore really won. Really, when are the sore losers from the left stop thier bitching and moaning? YOU LOST! Get over it already. Back to the issue on Iraq, if Moore actually said that liberals and Kerry voted for military action, I would have given this a three rating. But he didn't, because he's biased. He is an admitted Communist. And no, he did not make any money off of me. I purchased a ticket for another movie but seen this instead. Like Ive said, no knew information on current events was unfolded in this piece. Mr. Moore was simply doing what he does best- making millions on the deaths of innocents. He's is a really awesome at propaganda pieces. Joseph Goebbels would be jumping for joy if he seen this. Moore complains that there are not enough troops in Iraq. Why doesn't he sign up? Huh? It would do his fat body some good. This comment may sound like a personal attack, and it some way it is. But I hate liars and hypocrites who love to distort the American public."

I cannot believe I saw this completely crappy and pointless movie. I'm sorry if I'm being crude here, but it was just so disappointing to see Leo make a fool out of himself. I paid 5 freaking bucks to 1.) have all my friends make a joke out of me for about a week (because I was the one who made them go see it). 2.) Have NO ONE at all trust me when I would say Hey, this movie looks good let's go see it! (no matter what movie I was reffering to). And 3.) Have to sit for about 2 hours that seemed to be the longest of all my life, to discover I had just made a fool out of myself by actually dragging my friends along (atleast if I wouldn't have, I would have been the only one suffering). The movie made me feel crappy and unwanted. Can't describe it anymore! It deserves a 0.1, but the lowest was a 1, so I'll just have to compromise!"

I had such high hopes for it. Great cast, with incredible potential, the screencaps looked amazing (I will give it that, the sets and costumes were bang on). Even the music was good, using 'The Mystic's Dream' by Loreena McKennitt as the theme. However, none of that could make up for the horrible butchering of the story, seemingly for entertainment's sake. Granted, I only saw that last 2 hours of the film. But after that, I have no intention of ever seeing that first 2. I won't spoil it for anyone that, for whatever cracked out reason, wants to see it, but when I saw Viviane's death, I became mildly violent. I'm actually getting fairly angry just remembering it, so I'll leave off by saying DON'T WATCH IT. At all. Especially (and I can't stress this enough), if you're a fan of the book. "

The stupid Dogvillians end up calling the gangsta to get her daughter, knowing that they will probably kill her. Well, turns out, Nicole Kidman is the daughter of the Gangsta who she hates and is running away from. But she hates the Dogvillians even more. Gangstas kill everyone in Dogville and burn the town down. Nicole Kidman personally kills the idiot so-called boyfriend who did nothing to help her. The End. [Original Post] I went to Blockbuster last night. All the Van Helsing's were checked out so it was either Dogville or Envy. I picked poorly. If just one humanoid reads my review and avoids renting or viewing Dogville, I will feel that RateItAll serves some purpose to mankind. Dogville was truly horrid; it was more like Dog Pile. I'll get to that in a second. The pretentious and rich Brie, Chianti, and Latte Liberals who drive huge Hummers to the Sundance Festival (yet object to common families driving SUVs) praise this anti-American dreck to no end. And why is it that every movie that airs at Sundance truly sucks. Am I that much out of touch with the Pseudo-Intelligentsia who down our country at every turn, yet invest heavily in Defense stocks. Dogville also did well at Cannes; but considering the even more seditious Fahrenheit 911 won Palm D'Or, that doesn't say much. Dogville is something like Our Town, except it sucks. I'm sure the poseurs and artsy-fartsy phonies marvel at the naturalistic setting where instead of a mean barking dog, the word Dog is written on the floor and supposed to represent the purportedly mean canine. The story deals with a miserable little village called Dogville (symbolic of America), where people are mean and talk real slow and stupid-like (symbolic of Americans). Nicole Kidman drops into a town as a Bimbo running from Gangsters (I think she is a symbol of the enlightened foreigner, but who cares). The cast is pretty good with Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany and others who should have known better. But despite the big-buck cast, the movie has a feel of high school thespians reading off cue cards. Boredom and Tedium bludgeons you from opening credits. My wife, no kidding, was KO'd to sleep by the movie in the first 5 minutes. It took me three days to suffer through it. I would fall in and out of repose only to be bored back into somnelescence again by the dreadfully stultifying and sonorous dialogue. At first, no one does anything interesting or exciting. The first viewing of it, after about 45 minutes, I pulled the plug on the movie to watch the Auburn-Mississippi game (far more intellectually stimulating). Then the movie goes from boring to disturbing and depressing. Supposedly the Danish dude who made this flick is making an allegory to how awful and rotten we Americans are, particularly in our treatment to outsiders. I guess the Danish dude thinks we ugly Americans should be more cordial to Arab terorrists after they butcher 3,000 of us. God, this movie really stinks. Anybody who says they like it also thinks Friends is funny, You can't be too gay, and 911 transpired because we had it coming. Hopefully, Van Helsing will be available next week."

S"Based on Brett Easton's equally absurd book, this turkey belongs in the elite class of films like Ishtar, Heaven's Gate, Hudson Hawk etc. Granted, it does accurately portray the greedy, power-hungry, self-centered, Stepford Wife mentality of the 80's yuppie, wall street crowd, but everything else is pathetic. Christian Bale was too old for the lead role and his acting was beyond terrible. Willem Dafoe and the great Reese Witherspoon, were wasted in their small roles. The book failed miserably at it's attempt to get real deep and psychological so the movie tries even harder and fails even worse. The did he or didn't he angle was a great idea but neither the author nor the director had the talent to pull it off. Then, to make it even worse, the director tried to make it look 'artsy'...PUH-LEASE !!... I think every copy of this pitiful movie should be burned. What a waste of time and effort."

With ROCKY II, Aliens, Terminator 2, God Father II, as examples of sequels worthy of the originals;lets reset the bar.Pretend Revolutions directly follows The Matrix.

I refuse to reward Jim Davis' next effort to over-commercialize his characters and grab more money with more than one star. I mean, the Garfield comic's storyline isn't complicated. Would it have been so difficult to stay true to it? Nermal is a cute, gray kitten. Arlene is tall and white. And having Liz give in to Jon's affections completely butchers the personalities of both characters. And would it have been so tough for ALL the animal characters to be CGI, and not just Garfield?"

Typical America. The girls who holds out get the guy and the girl who gives it up sits on the side of the road selling junk nobody wants. Thanks for that dose of reality. Thankfully sleep claimed me an hour and 45 minutes into the show or I may have had to look at that aweful selection for Joe Cable. Hmm., Ameil was OK.

He said that the basic plot (they wouldn't let her out, even though she was a voluntary patient) completely lacked credence. As for Angela Jolie's character, there didn't apopear to be anything wrong with her. What was she doing in a nut house? As for having her undergo EST, as if any hospital would do that to a completely sane person against their will, even in the 60s! What a load of rubbish. "

I can only assume that all of the actors with any name recognition were followers of Scientology, and that is the only reason why this film was not locked into a vault. The unbelievable nature of the film cannot be denied. No one beyond the age of four could possibly be held in disbelief for one simple reason: gold is not the most presious metal on the planet, let alone the universe.

Why did the girl take a horse when she was trying to save Chow Yun Fat if she could just fly through the tree tops? Just to silly for words and a waste of $15.50 '

S"Quite simply, I hated this movie. Dustin Hoffman's scenery-chewing Captain Hook was annoying, and Robin Williams gets unintentional laughs as Peter Pan, running around in that ridiculous outfit. The lost boys are a bunch of little brats and heathens who need their behinds thrashed, and even Julia Roberts' usual charm wore thin as Tinkerbell. This is definitely one of Steven Spielberg's lesser efforts."

S"junk. it is a tour of what goes on around brilliance, but it never actually portrays any. this leads me to believe that it's writers, are also, not brilliant. it's a smoke screen. you hear about how great the kid's book is, but you never hear or see any great writing. you see marilyn monroe's old jacket. so what? at the end, michael douglas says, oh, and crabtree? he's still busy being crabtree. huh? crabtree (downey) got virtually no exposition. what is that statement exactly supposed to mean to us? beats me. oh, and there's a dead dog in a car trunk at one point. now that's wacky. i hate to give such a low rating, but this movie is pushing for all that it can to be some kind of dead poets society, and it simply has none of the substance which in such movies is essential. i can't believe people get suckered by this kind of obvious hype. it's a waste of time."

The biggest problem is that it is written for you to feel sorry for Sam (the retarded father) and for him regain custody of his 7 year old daughter. But every ounce of common sense sides with the bad guys that believe Sam should not have sole custody. The movie is aimed at making you feel that a father with an IQ of a 7 year old should be able to take care of his daughter himself. It just doesn't work."

First off, there is no creativity or imagination present--like too much of today's entertainment, it is a pure reality, present day movie with nothing beyond the norm. There are no clear heroes or villains, and everyone has too many flaws to be chosen as the character to support. Angst and anger is omnipresent throughout, as not a single ray of optimism can be found anywhere in this feature. The ending is perfectly dreadful as well, as everyone is either dead or miserable.

There was violence for violence's sake, and all Gibson did was tell us a story we already know; yet, it's a story that is uncontested. The subtitles were distracting and took a lot away from the performances given by the actors. The saddest part is Gibson's statement (along with his father) that the Holocaust was a mainly fictionalized event -- but unlike the death of Christ, we actually have documented evidence of the Holocaust. It sickens me that Gibson is making so much fortune off a film about a religious figure. Kind of ironic, is it not?"

S"Before I saw Hannibal I knew that it would and could never live up to Silence of the Lambs. A few months before the film even opened, I heard of all the A-List Talents that were behind this film. Editor Pietro Scalia (Good Will Hunting), Screenwriter Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) and David Mamet (Probably the Greatest Modern American Playwright) are all part of the creative process that you'd think this movie would at least be a good sequel to a fantastic modern masterpiece. Then comes Ridley Scott, who, in my opinion is a hot and cold director. He directed such great films like Gladiator, Thelma and Louise and Blade Runner. But his resume also states he directed G.I. Jane, White Squall and 1492: Conquest of Paradise. (Need I say more?) After seeing the film, you really can't blame Sir Anthony Hopkins or Julianne Moore for this terrible love story masquerading as a suspenseful cat-and-mouse game. The blame truly goes to Ridley Scott here. This film is so awful that you can see the actors, and the creative team trying their best to make something out of bad material since it is the sequel to Silence. At times the screenplay delivers some witty reparte, and the language that Hannibal Lecter uses sometimes captures the original's rhythm and feel. There are great moments with John Mathieson's cinematography, especially the scenes in Italy and Hans Zimmer's score is one of his best in my opinion. But the pacing was so inconsistent, and the chemistry between Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins feel forced. Julianne Moore does her best to a role that truly doesn't belong to her and Anthony Hopkins looks freaky alright, but his performance at times feel a bit paint-by-numbers. There are plenty of holes unfilled in the plot too. (Why can't we know more about Hannibal's past caretaker, Barney? He's a really interesting guy! If Hannibal's in the ten most wanted list of the FBI, how did he ever make it through Airport Security? If everyone is using the internet to catch Hannibal since the internet is loaded with Hannibal information, why is he so hard to find?) There are some really stupid moments in the film. For example, for ten years the FBI has been trying their best to capture our beloved Cannibal but it takes two seconds for three Italian thugs to knock him out and dump him in the back of a van . . . WITH A TASER GUN! Oh and the final ten minutes of the film is so ridiculous you leave the theatre laughing at how low filmmakers can go with gore. And the brain eating scene just gives you a headache (literally) because it's so contrived and it feels so set up for the audience to squiggle and squirm that it comes off as one of the corniest gags in Hollywood History. I wonder what Jonathan Demme has to say after seeing the sequel to his original? "

Not that I eat much fast food, but since I have seen this movie it is unlikely that I ever will again. I have even thought of buying a copy on dvd to control my late night binges. Trust me, this movie will make you feel like a fat american, even if you are not. Most of all, I was impressed with the amount of research that went into this movie. Its claims were grounded and arguments were well supported (though there was no main underlying statement such as DONT EAT FAST FOOD!). The best part about this movie is that it has sparked neccessary change. Since the movie was released McDonalds no loner offers Super Size Meals and I am noticing more and more articles focusing on an individual's portion size for a meal. I know that many of you refuse to give up that big mac and fries, but I still urge you to watch this movie, it really might change your mind."

We see a young white racist thug and the hate he emulates from his father's view on life and eventually anger over his father's death. This hate and anger spirals as a contributing factor to his downfall and passes onto his brother. What I also liked about this film is that Ed Norton's character can see that his brother Danny is a mirror image of himself before he went into prison and he knows in order for Danny to get through life he needs to change it as hate will not conquer all."

For the time, the movie brought people into the institutions for the mentally ill, and showed the terrible conditions and primitive techniques for rehabilitation. The main character also has his own delusions when he believes he knows best what's for the mental patients and trys to force them iont society, and finds they breakdown.

Tobey Maguire is excellent as Red Pollard as he portrays his hurt, anger and pride. The horse and the jockey understand each other and it shows. Jeff Bridges is superb as Charles Howard, the man who takes Pollard in and never gives up on both of them. The real stand out is Chris Cooper as the reticent horse trainer Tom Smith. The horse racing scenes are wonderful, but the movie does right to focus on the lives and interaction of the three men. It is a great movie of perserverence."

S"well what to say... do i give this movie a high rating becasuse it effected me so? or do i give it a low rating because it didn't effect me in a nice way? do i give it a high rating becase it changed me --in a blunt painful way--for the better? or a low rating because i didn't feel good about the fact that the whole fcking movie was about drug addiction and the fact that drug (andother) addictions don't usually end happily? Hmmm... this is a dilemma... i'm just really not sure.. i mean, i like puppy dogs, and there were none... that's a minus.. also i enjoy chocolate sundae's with peanuts on top, and i think the best i got was a shared icecream cone during the summer segment-- also the whole summer fall winter thing was stupid, becasue who wants to be left off in the middle of the cold winter! what happened to spring huh? i like spring, and the blooming of flowers like everyone else! everyone likes flowers!!!!! and yes, todd, i also agree with your point about nudity-- it would have been more than appropriate for what's her name to have gotten naked-- and ENJOYED it for god's sakes-- i mean c'mon, i agree, she's a really hot girl, so what's the problem? hot girl should = sexy nudity scenes right? of course it should! is there some piece of the equation im missing?? seems fairly simple to me! i mean if you think about it, if she would have gotten really sexy at that part where she has to go dance for all those old drunk men and stick that petrolem jelly dildo up her but because she has nothing left but drugs in her life and knows her boyfirend is as hopelessly addicted as she is and can't come back for the same reason-- she might have gotten even more money and drugs-- i mean if she wouldn't have been so emotional about the danm thing she could have made an even nicer profit and enjoyed herself at the same time! golly, that director, and that writer man, sure are missing some common sense!!!"

I liked her struggle and how she ended up as a pilot. Maybe because I have two daughers and a beautiful wife, I can appreciate a film that encourages women and girls to accomplish, have high standards, and behave ethically. Girls need this kind of role model. Wife says it's a girl power movie. I thought it was great!"

Don't get me wrong, the sequel had the same expected humour impact, but a bit more sensitive. If you thought you got to know the characters really well in the previous movie, this one actually goes deeper into their true feelings and exhibits their emotions at a better level conclusive level. By the end of the film you know that American Pie 2 provided a close to all characters and relationships, therefore making it very hard for a next sequel. Overall, I was pretty satisfied, and even surprised with the outcome of American Pie 2, since I had much lower expectations from it."

Rayamond has inherited all the money.Charlie kidnaps his brother in hopes of getting his cut of the money. they go for a 2000 ride to California. Raymond turns out to have savant capabilities in memory and counting.he uses his brother to get some money in Vegas. the good side of this movie is Charlie learns that Raymond cannot change.So Charlie has to change for his brother and do what is best for him.this movie is funny, sad, and heartwarming.Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job playing RAymond the autistic man. I have a relative with autism, I feel they handeld this movie dealing with autism with fairness without making fun of those with autism.'

S"I have probably seen this movie easily 50 times as I would consider it my favorite movie of all time. I would agree with an earlier comment that it does leave you with a rather empty feeling, as it has a bittersweet ending, but I think with a title like Almost Famous I didn't view the movie expecting to see the feel-good movie of the year. I thought it was real, and a very deep look at human nature and emotions, and is not just a movie about what life was like for rock stars in the 70's, but for all people in any time period. I thought Kate Hudson was amazing. She was the perfect actress for this movie. The rest of the cast was absolutly perfect as well. There was just enough humour, executed perfectly, to make Almost Famous fairly light hearted without taking away from the drama. The soundtrack is fantastic as well, I just paused through the credits and wrote down every song, as they are all fantastic, and the actual soundtrack should have been about 4 disks, 1 doesn't do it justice."

That seems a little bit much! While the previously mentioned trio did steal the show, I think Oscar talk is a little silly for this kind of movie. It makes you laugh, which is what this kind of movie is supposed to do. As mentioned before, Tara Reid steals the show with such HILLARIOUS lines as The walls are mushy! , If I could go back in time...I would meet Snoopy! , I know what we can do...raise money for a search party, and organize a bake sale! and my person favorite But wouldn't it be cool if you could be in two rooms at once...I could be in here...AND over there!

The movie makes you get into the story, it's not just plain killing. Reservoir Dogs takes you into a roller coaster of emotions. So, this is a very intense movie. You got to watch it!!!"

I had never seen anything so original, so funny, so dark, so incredible in my entire life at that point. This movie opened the door to original ideas in the movie making industry. This film is one of the best independent films of our time and deserves to be recognized for the brilliant masterpeice of modern film making that it is. Superior cast. My favorite Bruce Willis character ever because it breaks his usual mold of John McClain action flicks. Highly recommended absoloutly mesmerizing. A masterpeice. '

S'Saw Finding Forrester last night. What an excellent movie. No car chases, violence or sex, and yes it was predictable but that is because the movie was real. The characters made decisions and played the roles of real people not supper human, everything is perfect people. In all I thought the movie was great story telling. Several scenes could have been overplayed and overacted. The producer seemed to maintain a very tight reign on how far affects and acting played on emotion and opted to allow the story to become a participating character and fill those voids. Example, the scene where Wallace gets Forrester out of his apartment for the first time to go to a basketball game and Forrester gets lost and becomes very confused with great anxiety. This could have been over dramatized with effects, music, and human emotion building a grand suspense moment. Instead, they allow the story to remain the character and you to understand the moment not caught up in the drama. Some will not enjoy the movie simply because it is relatively flat. My enjoyment came from watching superb professionals portray their characters without the crutches of effects. Sometimes it is much harder to convince the audience you are the real character without the supporting cast of the special effects department. A great feel good movie that does not leave you emotionally rung out and exhausted at the end.'

NO kid would rather the museum over Scooby Doo... I haven't watched the show in a long time and to go to the movies and see it was like seeing the cartoon characters in real life. The actors that partrayed these roles were great! I mean, like Matthew Lillard... I never was too big of a fan of his, but in this role he was hilarious!! I remember one part where he said something I found myself laughing for like 20 minutes ahahaha.. I would go se the movie again just for that part.. haha okay well anyways.. Freddie Prince Jr .. Whoa baby!! Even with blonde hair he is a sexy papa! And he was hilarious in this role too.. As were all of the actors.. Sarah Michelle Gellar was great! I found myself laughing at her lot.. She was adorable in her the little purple dress he wore, but nehoo!! The woman who playes Thelma was great! The movie was great! Whoa! I think I'm taking up too much space so I'm gonna go!

But by the time 13 Days was over, I'd forgotten all about Lord of the Rings. Being from Canada, I wasn't very familiar with the story. All I knew was that the situation must've been resolved, since I knew nothing of a war between the States and Cuba. But having an idea about how the movie would end didn't spoil it at all. Every second of this movie was fascinating. It was intense without having action sequences. The high point in my opinion is the performance given by the actor portraying Bobby Kennedy. I can easily say that 13 Days is one of my favorite movies of the last few years, and I can't wait to see it again. It was quite a long movie, but it kept my interest throughout every scene. 13 Days is currently on top of my movie recommending list."

S'It might discourage some to describe this extraordinary 2004 PBS documentary as "the real thing" about the events of a decade ago related in \'Hotel Rwanda\' in 2004. And yet, there is so much about the filmed testimony that is objective and factual that the narration and the filmed records allow the viewer to acknowlede objectively the responsibilities of the local and foreign parties who, through direct action or inhuman apathy, were involved in the tragedy in one way or another. Remarkably fair in its judgment of the abysmal and abundant human error, this is an unforgettable experience. '

This film recreates the era with such fun and such joy. Also worth noting is David Hyde Pierce's wildly funny supporting performance. Great sets and costumes, hilarious jokes , and terrific actors make this a genuinely lighthearted flick worth watching."

S"What a great action movie. Lethal Weapon modernized the classic buddy picture (e.g., Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) and ushered in a host of imitators that also pair up unlikely male buddies of different races (Rush Hour, Last Boy Scout, Wild Wild West, just to name a few). But the imitators can't match the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover chemistry that drives the movie and makes you care about the characters. Lethal Weapon has great action scenes, great dialogue, and better acting than you'll find in most action movies."

S"No Oscar marterial, but an intriguing film with a few good lessons to be learned. Russell Crowe's characters' schizophrenia had sort of a double meaning...he saw the world diferently than others did. Sort of like I noticed that everyone seemed to have blue eyes, and everyone else thought I was insane...guess I'm the only one who noticed it. This was probably one of the best movies I've seen all year (up there with Life As A House ) and if the directors don't WAKE UP and start making a couple of REALLY good films, it may end up winning and deserving most of the awards. Overall, a pretty good Ron Howard job with outstanding acting by Russell Crowe Co. Take care, everyone!"

The powerful ending presents a narrative from the grave as Spacey's character, with Christlike forgiveness, dies for us and suggests the existence of a path that might take us through the thicket of materialism, egotism, and sexuality that characterizes the American landscape. Spacey's character sights a higher path during the long second before death; hopefully, we will see this path less traveled earlier in our own individual journey."

The film touches on many subjects without being preachy , leaving the viewers with room for interpretations and thoughts which I think is clever . The music score and cinematography are perfect . I indeed prefer the movie than the book which can actually be preachy and full of prpogandas . For those who are offended by the abortion and incest themes , give me a break . What is the morality portrayed in American Beauty ( guns , infidelity and rape of the underaged girl ! ) ? Why people rarely condemn the themes in Pulp Fiction ( totally rubbish film which makes swearing sound cool and violence a norm ) ? I think many Americans are rather bored by such heart warming films like The Cider House Rules but cherish the violence and perverty in the aforementioned films . No wonder America has so many gunshot cases because people are so used to violence that guns are still not banned ! '

S'The nonfiction much-written-about events of this movie were not at all new to me, yet the impact of seeing \'End of the Spear\' was fresh, heart-piercing, motivating, and if ever the word should be used: poignant, that\'s what it was, poignant. U.S. missionaries in Ecuador seek out unreached cannibalistic Waodani tribe and are killed by them, and that\'s the beginning. Family members of missionaries then go to live with the tribe which then places trust in Christ. This redemption movie is told thru the eyes of a killed missionary\'s son. Highly recommend for Christians--don\'t know about nonChristians, they might find the concept absurd. For ex, when the son as a kid asked his dad if they would shoot the Waodani if attacked, the dad said, "Son, we can\'t shoot the Waodani, they\'re not ready for heaven, we are." (Well-done and beautiful film, but suspend disbelief as regards the failure of makeup to show aging of characters over decades.) '

It will not dazzle you with visual effects, hunky leading men, or a thrilling plot. But what it will dazzle you with is its poetic and thought provoking dialogue, its perfectly depicted story of suburban life, its subtle but brilliant music score composed by Thomas Newman, and most of all, its very impressive acting. This film achieves what many directors often fail to do. It manages to be a perfect combination of humour, drama, romance and a reminder of how we can take the most beautiful things on Earth for granted sometimes. In the words of Lester Burnham (Spacey), You have no idea what I'm talking about I'm sure. But don't worry, you will someday."

S'This movie may be rated PG, but the humor is definitely not geared toward children. Of course, neither was Pee Wee s Playhouse for the most part. One of the most creative, quirky and unique films ever made, Pee Wee s Big Adventure remains hilarious after 16 years. Many of the lines are burned in my memory not only from having watched this film many times but also because Pee Wee and this movie were so widely imitated at the time and well into the early 90 s. It s strange how some people seemed to forget how funny this movie was and how much they enjoyed it after Ruebens was caught attempting to cause himself to go blind in that Florida theater. Hugh Grant wasn t really doing much better than that himself once upon a time and it seemed to only boost his popularity. Hmmmmm.

S'I put seeing this movie off for a while because of its length, finally saw it this past weekend. It certainly falls in the category of different . Other than the plane crash, it doesn t really have any true action or suspense, but for some strange reason I couldn t pull myself away from wondering what was going to happen next. Now you might say, well that s suspense, it was and it wasn t. There have been a lot of films put out that tried to tap human suffering, or the human condition . Cast Away didn t just tap it, it tapped a main line feed from the core. Tom Hanks was brilliant, how many actors can take up over half of a movie solo and never loose an audience? Not many. I see some questioning the ending, at first I was a little miffed at its, seemingly clich who knows how what decision will be made ending. However, the more I thought about it, how else could it end. Anything else would have been considered predictable, too convenient, too wrapped up in a pretty bow. I thought the ending fit rather nicely within the whole theme of life sucks but not really too awful bad.'

S"Silence of the Lambs is high on my list of greatest movies ever made. Next to the Exorcist and Shining, definently one of the best horror/thriller films. Anthony Hopkins became my favorite actor after I saw this movie because his performance was the most breathtaking of it's kinda I had ever seen. And I've yet to come across anything to rival it(I didn't see Hannibal. I read the book and thought it was disgusting. I didn't want anything to tarnish my memories of Anthony's performance or the movie.) It was just so masterfully crafted, every syllable of every word he spoke, every little time he blinked or moved his eyes, every little, rare gesture he ever made- although what made this Hannibal guy so damn scary was that he didn't move. He stood perfectly still and always gave the observer this tense sort of-when-is-he-going-to-jump-up-and-eat-somebody feeling. You kept expected him to do something like that...but he never did. Not when you expected it, anyway. That, I think, is what made the scene with the guards near the end so amazingly frightening. He became almost this animal after a whole movie of never moving, never doing anything untoward. He became likable, even, this genius sociopathic murderer. His great line about the census taker still gives me chills to this day. I could write forever about the brilliant nuances of Hannibal Lecter, but I'm commenting on the movie as a whole, so I guess that will have to wait for another time. Jodie Foster, too, gave an excellent performance, what with that West Virginia accent and her heartfelt descriptions of the screaming lambs. Something that makes this movie so brilliant though, was that besides the chaotic exchanges between Clarice and Hannibal, there was actually a really frightening almost side story about the serial killer, Buffalo Bill. Clarice's scenes in his house were so chilling, they stay with me (as does a great amount of things from this movie) to this day. Johnathan Demme did an amazing job interpreting Ted Tally's outstanding screenplay and gave a such a dark, creepy air to the whole movie. Silence of the Lambs is one of those few movies that you can watch 20 times and still get scared. If you haven't seen it, firstly-are you crazy?! do you live under a rock? and secondly, go see it!!!!! You will enjoy it, I promimse you."

S'I really enjoyed this movie. Mostly I enjoyed the well fleshed out characterizations. For instance, even when you really hated the father for being so abusive to Billy or the brother for being so angry, once you have a chance to know their situation you still manage to have sympathy for them. And though Billy is portrayed as a likeable kid, they didn t try to make him a perfect angel either which did nothing to turn you against him and had everything to do with making him believable. The cast was terrific from poor old grandma to Billy s friend down the street. The only thing in the movie that did not seem to ring completely true was that Billy became a star of the ballet regardless of the fact that most ballet dancers begin at around the age of 3 and Billy but did not start taking lessons until he was nearly in his teens. But I guess the whole point was that this was a prodigal who beat the odds - and in more ways than one.'

S"I was a little cynical about seeing this because of the mixed reviews I'd received of it. Now I only wonder who could dislike it. One critic described it as one of the two most powerful films of all time, right up there with The Godfather. Well, this guy pretty much hit the nail on the head. By the end of this movie, I was unable to get up from my seat, and I still had the word horror playing in my head for about three more hours. Colenol Kurtz is an outstanding representation of every single aspect of the hell of the Vietnam War. The scenes of walking through the island near Cambodia with bodies everywhere and heads scattered all over the ground were to say the least, shocking. What's worse is that things like this probably happened. Take care, everyone!"

S"This is one of the most powerful movies of all-time. More importantly, it is one of the most important movies of all-time. Amazingly, there are still people who deny that the Holocaust ever happened. And, each year, there are fewer and fewer people still alive who survived the Nazi concentration camps. This movie is a reminder of the atrocities (and it really doesn't matter if Oskar Schindler really wasn't the hero that he was portrayed to be). It keeps the tragedy in the public conciousness and reminds us to never let something like this happen again. Sure, it is quite long and people have shied away because of the intense subject matter. Nevertheless, if you have never seen it, you have an obligation to the millions who died to do so."

S"A truly excellent movie from Disney. Mixing slick direction, great acting, an excellent and fascinating plot with great humor, this movie is a success from beginning to end. The plot and the progression of that plot is quite interesting and includes several great twists. Nicolas Cage leads an excellent cast which also includes Christoper Plummer and Jon Voight. I also love the pro-democracy vibe such as when Nicolas Cage looks in awe at a particular line that basically boils down to whoever has the power to do what is right has the responsibility to DO what is right. That's so true! Also, the ending is definately MY kind of ending!"

S'A nihilistic descent into schizophrenic madness that I can\'t stop watching. Maybe it\'s the intricate photographic work, maybe it\'s Fincher\'s ear for dialogue, maybe it\'s the spellbinding performances by Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meatloaf, and Brad Pitt, maybe it\'s all of the aforementioned.....it\'s an obsessive relationship that I never want to end. From the opening "needle drag" and Dust Brothers intro, you\'re swept into the dreary dirge of Norton\'s anticipated existence (recounted through jarring skips and flashbacks), never suspecting the ease with which he ends up dealing with his insomnia-induced repression. Shot through with trenchant humor, jabs at popular culture, and gnarly twists throughout, you\'ll find yourself enjoying it a little more than you should. A few "squirm and shifts" from time to time (and his name is Robert Paulson), but with a title like "Fight Club", you shouldn\'t expect shortbread at high tea. Get the disc and see for yourself why this film instills such ardor among its legion of loyal and eager fans.'

S"I just saw this movie a few nights ago- and all I can say is WOW. What a film! It is probably one of the most accurate historical dramas of our time. Definately up at the top of the list of the movies of the last few years. Two things bugged me about this film- the role of Ken O'Donnell was sorely misrepresented as he did not have nearly as much of a role in the crisis. The other was Kevin Costner's ridiculous attempt at a Boston accent. Other than that- this really proved to be an entertaining film with supurb acting, even by Kevin Costner. The actor who played John Kennedy, Bruce Greenwood was astounding- he had Kennedy's accent down pact. Overall, I would recommend this to even people who are not too fond of Kennedy as it does not portray him as some kind of a God, even mentioning his attempts at assassinating Castro during his term in office. Bruce Greenwood did a great job of communicating the President's struggles with the audience. Definately a film to see!"

As dark as the film seems, its really about mixed motives and the tension between idealism and cynicism, romance and realism, and principle and pragmatism. Its billed as a slam of the Clintons, but actually the portrayals are very humanizing in that there are in fact strong core values obscured by the hypocrisy and corruption. I actually came away liking the Clintons more. Emma Thompson was as usual just dazzling in her versatility, but Travolta really impressed me despite the stereotypical depiction. I actually forgot that I was looking at Travolta, whereas Im usually annoyed with him half way through the film because he normally inserts too much of his own personality into his characters. The supporting cast was superb right down to the minor characters with one or two lines."

I thought that this movie was very emotional. Sure the british soldier was wrong about burning the church with innocent folks, but who was higher in rank to stop him from burning innocent folks. So I say it was the Gerneral's fault who allow him to do what he was good at a evil valiant .

S"I was really impressed with 'Almost Famous'. It had a lot of starting out actors but they were all fantastic. The story is about a high school guy who is a really good writer. He gets a job with Rolling Stone (RS has no idea he is so young) to write a story about an up and coming band. He goes on tour with them but along the way a story that is sad, funny, exciting, adventerous, and romantic develops. This movie had it all. One thing I look for in a good movie whether it is a horror, romantic comedy, or an action adventure movie is if I get attacthed to the characters. 'Almost Famous' did the job. I was into all the characters. It has so many different messages intertwined in the movie. The music is amazing with a lot of Led Zeppelin. It is a really good date movie. I have just heard some breaking news this weekend about 'Almost Famous' that I had to come back and share. This news makes me like the movie ten times more now. This movie is based upon the directors life. He used to write for Rolling Stone magazine and follow bands like Zeppelin around when he was a teenager. There really is a Penny Lane. This news has changed my rating and I now have to give it a 5 start rating."

S"First let me get a few random words of advice out of the way: 1) Don't see this movie on a first date, 2) Don't eat dinner while watching this movie, and 3) Don't see this movie expecting to feel good afterwards. Requiem for a Dream is one of the most disturbing movies I've seen. Everything about it makes you uncomfortable - the downward spiral of each character, the relentless music, the jagged filming and editing techniques... everything. The acting performances are universally excellent. Ellen Burstyn, especially, gives an amazing performance as the lonely widow and mother who falls victim to a diet pill addiction. This is clearly not a movie for everyone, but it's hard to give such an unconventional, powerful film anything less than five stars."

S'not as good as Pulp Fiction but thats an unfair compaison. Kill Bill has an amazing story line and has many original parts(anime and the black and white fighting scenes). I understand that the blood seemed fake but thats missing the point of the movie. For those who love blood and guts, HIGHLY RECOMMENED'
