There was only one piece of camerawork that I particularly like and that was with the cars. It seems to me that this film doesn't even adhere to the original series and therefore should not have the title. Appalling. "

S"I've walked out of only two movies in my life, and one was Nurse Betty (the other was Endless Love, to give you some perspective). I went in expecting a light, entertaining comedy, and what I saw instead was graphic violence and really terrible acting. The movie is about a waitress who witnesses a serious crime, has a break with reality, and then believes she's an actress in her favorite soap opera. With a plot like that, I felt sure I was in for lots of laughs. What a shock it was to see the serious crime depicted in a very realistic, horrifying way and more violence (including lots of blood and gore) in subsequent scenes. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, playing the killers after Nurse Betty, should be ashamed of themselves. Their roles were definitely beneath them, and one of the worst parts was that no one in the theater laughed at any of their jokes. It was pathetic! I still feel disturbed by the violence I saw in the first hour of the movie. You have been warned!"

S"I know Garfield and this isn't it. It's just a boring, generic, anaemic kids movie. Garfield looks like c***, most of the acting is poor (especially Jennifer Love Hewitt, who acts so forced) and the plot is not true to the comic. For example, Garfield hates Odie. He doesn't become friends with him like he does here. Liz also hates Jon. Any date they went on in the comic strip was a disaster. Here, they like each other. The only acceptable performance is from Bill Murray as Garfield. The villain is generic kiddy c*** I've seen a thousand times over, and is acted out as such. The rescue is both unoriginal and unexciting. The rest of the animals are just normal animals, which looks kind of cheap and they are only related to the comic by name (for example, Arlene doesn't appear to be Garfield's girlfriend). In conclusion, if you're a Garfield fan, don't see this. Garfield: The Movie could have been interesting to watch, but it just isn't. I like the comic. I hate this movie. 1/5 stars - You've been warned "

The ending is completely different than the short story, Pygmmalion, that this 1964 movie is based on. I just can't recommend this production."

Gadzooks, she's one of the worst: I feel like I'm going to fall into a diabetic coma everytime she comes into the frame. Christopher Plumber, a truly gifted actor who's been gravely overlooked for decades, puts in a fine performance for a guy who's hardly the song and dance type, yet he doesn't actually sing or dance much in this flick. The children are obnoxious. The story is one of those typical Hollywood based on a true story feel-good bowel movements. There are a few decent songs in the score, but most of it is your usual musical filler. This was such a popular flick when it first came out, but looking at it today, it's hard to determine why. Of course, it's bland and easily digestible family fare, but please, it's so hokey and goody-goody that you just want to barf."

S"WELCOME! To horror movie hell. Hehe. I don't have three days to spend listing the flaws of this movie so I will just brush over the top. First it is by the guy who did the equally terrible Urban Legend. His visual styling is cute and all but it can't save these poo poo scripts. The characters are all inept and unlikeable. You honestly want them all to die horrible deaths. The deaths start out good but then as if it were a kiddie film just turn into sell out deaths and leave you with dull boring and unimaginitive deaths. Like when a certain big breasted bimbo gets trepped in the hot tub by a sheet ao hard reenfirced plastic and the killer is drilling down at her the killer gives up after 15 seconds and tosses the drill into the tub, electocuting her. Whoopdy doo! Haven't seen that before. Not even haveing the beautiful work of the Deftones on the soundtrack can help this peice o trash flick out. The ending and last death is really quit funny. Go see it if you are really bored and like disapointment. Would you hide in a body bag? And if the killer began stabbing the contense of every bag in that room would you stay perfectly still or run for it? Like I said, these are some stoopid ass kids."

S'Sorry folks, but this movie sucked. Hey, I love Francis Ford Coppola and Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder as much as anyone out there, but this was just bad. The costumes were terrible (excepting, of course, that see-through nightgown of Ms. Ryders), the acting was not very good and it BOMBED in the theaters. This has no business making this list so high, as it was a forgettable piece of junk.'

S"Witness, my friends, the crude of the crude: I can see this movie being used by women for evidence to kick guys off of the planet forever. At least, they should kick off mindless fools like the actors and writers of this numbingly-idiotic motion picture. In what has to be a record of some sort, over 200 (yes, you read it right, my friends, TWO HUNDRED) uses of the f-word can be cataloged. That's in addition to over 150 OTHER crude words. This makes you wonder if there could actually be any real dialogue. Of course, there is none. Crude and explicit sexual content is so crass and rampant that I can't get into it on this honorable public opinion forum. Drug use rivals the moronic Cheech Chong movies. Acting is bad, and I mean BAAAAADDDDD! Of course, George Carlin makes an appearance, so it is automatically bad. They've even got kids cussing in this movie! No child actor should be forced into a movie like this one! The list of crimes in this brain-dead movie goes on: its sexist, it has inappropriate music, there is imitative behavior that kids shouldn't replicate, graphic violence and disrespectful attitudes towards women and policemen. This movie is one of the worst movies of all time, that is for sure. Avoid this terror at all costs. Just go rent something nice and family-friendly, read a book, play a Nintendo game or write a story of your own. But, whatever you do, pay this waste of film no heed."

The Love Bug was one of several Disney films that came across as very one-dimensional, lacked wit, flare and was just silly. I know it was a big hit in its day but, in my case anyway, it just joined the ranks of the quickly produced, lame-o post-Walt stuff you too often found occasionally being churned out by Disney apparently for no other reason than to make a quick buck.

S". . . this is one of those ones where you're gonna either love it or hate it. I'm in the latter camp. Okay, so I haven't seen Rob Zombie's previous move, House of 1000 Corpses; I did figure, Yeah, this is probably going to be a little bizarre, violent, whatever, I can deal with that.. Besides, my husband really wanted to see it. He's the type who likes that bizarre stuff. I can deal with violence. But I don't appreciate POINTLESS violence much. I mean, really, there wasn't really much of a plot: Crazy possibly-imbred psycho family gets hunted down by equally psychotic sheriff. Yeah, whatever. If you're fairly sensitive to depictions of sexual violence, yeah, this movie DEFINATELY isn't for you. It was just one scene, but I seriously actually wanted to vomit. (Which is a feat, there's only one other movie that made me want to throw up; this movie also has the distinction of being one of the few that I've actually wanted to walk out of). And, what's worse, people in the theater were LAUGHING. WTF? I don't know what I was disgusted at more, the movie or the people in the theater. Okay, so that's my fault; I should've done some research before walking into the theater, I'll take full responsibility for that one. I don't really care if this movie pushed the extremes on violence, nudity, and profanity: yeah, it's never been done before, but it doesn't make it GOOD. If you're okay with all that, go ahead and buy the DVD, knock yourself out. At least I know better now to skip any future Rob Zombie flicks. "

So I went to the film confident it would at least be decent, but to my disappointment, my wife and I could barely sit through the thing. A few adjectives that quickly come to mind: dull, empty, juvenile, shallow, meaningless, self-indulgent, meanduring and pretentious. It wasn't like I was trying to learn the meaning of life by going to see this, but I simply found it incredibly unfunny and completely full of itself...the whole time I felt like I was on a hipster twenty-something MTV filmset watching them pretend to shoot a film, rather than a typical film experience.

I may be in the minority here, but I have to agree with Axelrod2003. Can someone tell me where the scary part was? I also agree with BigBaby. The ending totally sucked. Too many unanswered questions and pieces that didn't fit together. It seemed as though the director had several ideas going at once and couldn't decide which direction to go.

S"I'm here to set things straight on RateItAll.com once and for all. This is to be my first opinion. Here I go: Bringing Down the House, does not necessarily tell a story which is outdated, but rather one which should embarass humanity into making its reddest face and its most solemn look of all. Let's look at the issues tackled in this film, set in 2003: 1)Slavery, 2)Black (and White) Stereotypes, and 3) Cultural Appropriation. Slavery officially ended over 100 years ago, (to those born more recently, right after Gettysburg and Gods and Generals took place), but as we can obviously see in our day to day experience, racism is still rampant, be it in the white dominated media, the movies, or in general conversation and confrontation. What is baffling to me is why this film should combine an early 1800s attitude towards blacks with our current sensibilities in such an artless and tasteless manner. Steve Martin's character and his family can't be seen in public with Latifah? She has to pose as their nanny to be accepted socially?...I can't even finish. The fact that this movie was a success theatrically just shows how ignorant we are as a culture. What a sloppy and hopeless pile of poo this movie was. (Note: Despite these issues I have brought up briefly, I have to say that this film began with the most boring internet scene of all time. Any filmmaker who thinks that filming a computer being used for Instant Messaging is a good way to engage viewers is stoned.) "

S"Correct me if I am wrong, but, in most horror movies, isn't it the general consensus that we want the protagonist(s) to get away from the evil killer? I think that is the only respect in which Valentine differs from stupid horror movie fare. You actually want these horrid actors to die. Even though the deaths were really disapointing. I suppose the idea in itself is meritorus, but it just came out to be a jumbling mixture of over and under acting, at-times confusing plotline, not to mention the pathetic killer. The murderer is suppose to invoke within the viewer a sense of tense watchfulness. Who will be next? How will they die? In Valentine, one just sits there, not really caring who dies and how (except for when it's really funny like when that crazy guy dies by iron). All in all, I (big surprise) have to say that I do not recommend this movie. Well not if you want to be scared, at any rate. If you want to have a laugh at the expense of a crappy film, well then by all means."

Later, I figured out that it was The greatest zombie movie ever. March 14, 2004, I saw it. It was the stupidest thing I had ever seen(and i've seen House of the Dead). Terrible acting. Unrealistic zombies. No action. Pointless. No where near as good as the remake. This movie sucked. Almost all of Romero's movies suck.

The characters are so unbelievably shallow and the plot so predictable, that I found myself laughing as each character was picked off. If you should decide to ignore my warning and watch this movie, be ready to laugh, and keep in mind that the law of energy conservation cannot be upheld by the theory set forth in this movie.

This movie follows the book in no way except that the good guy is Alex Cross and the bad guy is Gary Sonja. This film grows into nothing. You end up feeling nothing for any character at all. And when ah ha moments fail to make you go ah ha. That is a sighn of failure. Kiss the Girls wasn't much better in that respect. Anyway, I recommend reading the books.

The dancing is nothing new, and the plot is overused. This will probably make some impact at the box office, but that just goes to show the intelligence of the movie going public.

It includes not just premarital sex, but drug use, violence and nudity. The creators and actors in this film note that they had to find a non-obnoxious way to make a modern teen a virgin. That's right, my friends, being pure is obnoxious and unpopular. (I've never heard anything more ridcioulous!) Thankfully, the film didn't gross much, but several teenagers I know wanted to watch it at school. This film certainly has cruel intentions, to corrupt the teenagers of our time. Avoid at all costs."

Right up there with the death-inducing Dogville in terms of boredom. We watched it one night, wifey passed out in 10 minutes and I made it to 15. She blamed me that looking at my droopy eyes made her fall asleep. We tried again a couple of nights later. She konked out in 8 minutes this time while I pretty much drifted off to sleep about the same juncture as the previous night. She had the chutzpah to say the next morning, I still want to see it. Now how good of a movie could it be if it puts 2 fairly intelligent adults asleep twice? My theory is that I just can't stand Charlie Kauffman movies, as I Found Being John Malkovich almost as boring and stupid. Kauffman looked like such a dork at the Oscars during his acceptance speech. 30 seconds, 29 seconds, I find this very unsettling, 26 seconds, I can't think of any thing to say, this is so distracting, 24 seconds..."

I\'ll tell you one thing, I would NEVER want to have to go up against that guy on the old game show "Make Me Laugh." Decent actor, but his career isn\'t merely going down the toilet, it\'s clogged in the pipes.'

S'Vin Disel makes an effort in this awful action thriller, that looks almost like a TV film. A Man Apart tells the story of a man who loses his wife during a shootout, and then decides to take revenge on the killers. The film drags on for about one hour too long, and the action scenes are overdone. Disel is good, but his action skills are hardly anything special.'

Mr. Spurlock makes no compelling case against McDonald's or fast food in general. He accuses McDonald's of being interested only in the bottom line, yet when his doctor's advise him to discontinue his experiment he bravely forges on so he can finish his film and sell it to the masses.

It glorifies criminals who kill not just one, but hundreds. It also has protagonists that beat their wives, cuss up a storm and are apathetic towards moral, good people. Also, the length of the movie is insanely long. The movie is re-aired so much on television that it gets terribly annoying to even hear it is coming on the tele. It lacks the energy, creativity, and optimism of masterpieces like Star Trek, Star Wars, Pokemon, Toy Story and so many more great, underrated franchises.

Tom Arnold and Arnold Schwarzenneger had a very unique chemistry, and I thought that Tom Arnold did a wonderful job as the wisecracking annoying sidekick. I espescially like his line at the end: I'm sick of sitting in the van.... . Jamie Lee Curtis also gave a great performance as Schwarzenegger's clueless, naiive, shy wife. I love the way she makes the transition from good little housewife to bad girl in her notorious dance scene. That scene was both hilarious and sexy. I reccomend this film to anyone who is a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis or Schwarzenneger, or if you're just looking for a funny as hell action flick."

S'Though it is getting damned with faint praise by the critics, I find (as a Potter non-reader) that the Potter stories get increasingly more compelling to the adult viewer. Goblet of Fire was an interesting and exciting movie. I liked seeing that while Harry can go toe-to-toe with the fiercest dragons and the evilest of Dark Lords, he can\'t get laid. You\'d think he can just wiggle [both] his magic wands at the delightfully witchy and firm buttocks of Hermoine Granger and her Hogwarts\' skirt would magically go up and her little black witch thong would go down. At last I get to see the bad-assed dude named Voldermort. As with most horror movies (except for Alien), what you imagine is far scarier than what you see on screen. Voldermort looked something like the lovechild of Nosferatu and the Creature from the Black lagoon. And if he\'s so damned evil, how could he let little Potter essentially kick the shiite out of him in a battle to the death. It would be like one of the Olsen Twins knocking out Mike Tyson. Of course, it\'s only a movie. The big issue is that this PG-13 is for real. Some stupid Daddio behind me took his six-year kid to watch th movie. Every 10 minutes, stupid Daddio is reassuring his kid, "It\'s not that scary, right?" Near the end of the movie, the 6-year old sounds like he\'s peed his pants in terror and is moaning at images of skeletons and blood and death. Idiot Daddio is going, "It\'s okay...you\'ll be alright." Li\'l Dude is probably not going to be able to sleep for the next 10 years. '

S"Interesting that the movie is listed under the comedy category. Moore brilliantly utilizes a constant change of tone and emotion to keep the viewer's attention throughout the entire movie. There is not a down-point in this cinematic masterpiece. It departs from the status quo of hit movies today, acting as an expos of America's culture of fear. Moore directed a thought-provoking film, intellectually challenging the person watching to examine the very society in which they live. The documentary-style film travels around the country, interviewing people from the surprisingly articulate Marilyn Manson to Charlton Heston and two victims of the Columbine High School massacre. Capitalizing on the themes of his book Stupid White Men, Michael Moore explores the view of African Americans as criminals and menaces to society as well as the major theme of the danger of gun violence and why it occurs more frequently in America than any other civilized country. He uses resources such as actual footage of the Columbine shooting, facts about brash, reactionary measures taken by the U.S. throughout the world in the past half-century, and newscasts from local evening news stories to amplify the point he's trying to make. Whether you agree with him or not, this film is undeniably credible and keeps you entertained throughout; it created in me at various points sentiments of anger, sadness, laughter, disbelief, and awe. That fact speaks volumes about its merits as an effective work."

Gene Hackman stars as a new high school coach with a mysterious past, and his approach to coaching raises the eyebrows of his players and the townspeople alike. Hackman's character forges ahead, and eventually takes his team to the Indiana state finals. The build-up to the finals was very effective, and I found myself totally involved in the outcome. After living in a small town in Indiana for two years, I can attest to the fact that people really are that obsessed with basketball! If you're looking for an absorbing, feel-good movie, try renting Hoosiers. You won't be disappointed."

This is a movie that had me tearing up at the idea of one man making such a large difference. This is one of the greater movies, I belive, ever made. '

S"One of the best films I saw last year. What I liked about it is that there were no special effects or big budget hollywood studios sticking their ore in, just a movie making room for sheer entertainment. Throughout this movie the story keeps you interested, the character's are real the dialogue's convincing not to mention outstanding performances from the children to the adults. A well told story, Clint Easwood is truly a extra-ordinary story teller."

Spacey is beyond excellence in his portrayal of a lust-struck man in midlife, and all the other characters are almost as vibrant in their depiction and almost as well casted. The way it's told, after his death, is intriguing and it works well in this case. This is a masterpiece that will be known 200 years from now as great literature, the way we know Lady Chatterly's Lover today."

S"Wow! I had enormous expectations still it was better than I thought it would be! This is the most dramatic movie I've ever seen, one of the most ironic! This is theatre on film! Hopefully it will create a new aera where theatre people start making films! Sam Mendes MAY become the greatest of all directors in the movie history - at least his first film is absolutely terrific! More than anything else, it's the script that overwhelmed me! I expected a deep movie, while it's in fact as entertaining as Todo sobre mi madre. I totally disagree that the characters in this movie is cartoon-like. Again I would compare it to the much more cartoony Todo sobre mi madre. Great acting of course. And fasten your seatbelts: The ending is like taken out of an Agatha Christie novel! Even better than The Sixth Sense' ending! The film teqniques is better than The Matrix, Fight Club Todo sobre mi madre added together! A little better than American Pie, which I think is the second best movie of the year! Hope it'll get tons of Oscars! The only thing I didn't like with this film was actually the trailer, hehehe! It didn't tell me much, but maybe that was only positive. It made my cinematic experience even more overwhelming! I think it's the 5. best movie I've seen to date, after Forrest Gump, Gandhi, La vita bella Dogme 1 - Festen! :-D"

S"Thoroughly enjoyed Anchorman. Will Ferrell is on a hot streak. Old School and Elf were good movies, but Ferrell's portrayal of Ron Burgundy kept me in stitches throughout the flick. The movie did a great job in placing you in the 1970s (unlike the awful That '70s Show, which has no clue on what the '70s or humor is). It also captures the soul of San Diego, though some of the backdrops of the city were of recent vintage and were kind of an anachronism. The love/hate/love relationship of Burgundy and co/rival anchorwoman Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate looks great) is a riot. But the real hilarious stuff occurs with Burgundy's downright insane on-scene reporter, sports guy, and weatherman. The fight scene between Burgundy's crew and the rival station news teams (watch for A-List cameos) was one of the funniest fight scenes ever staged. The DVD has a ton of special features. Ferrell's music video of Afternoon Delight is spit your food out funny."

It is one of the best protrayals of actual American history I have ever seen, and it really brings out some of the work necessary to bring about the greatest technological achievement of all time, and the amount of danger in which the astronauts could easily find themselves. When Tom Hanks made his series on the Apollo missions, his Apollo thirteen episode concentrates on aspects separate from those portrayed in this movie, which allows this movie to become a working part of the series. The work of Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise brings out some of the greatness of this film, while Tom Hanks easily portrays the pain of aborting a lunar landing. If you haven't seen it, you should.

Adrien Brody was simply incredible in this role -- I can think of no one who could have done it better. One of the most powerful scenes is when he is walking down the street crying and there are hundreds of suitcases and belongings strewn on the sidewalks and in the road. I also like the fact that a German soldier is portrayed in a favorable light -- he helped Wladyslaw when things weren't looking so good. He also spared Wladyslaw's life (and in real life, the lives of other Jews) but was still imprisoned by the Russians after the surrender in Europe and subsequently died in a POW camp years later. So tragic, and so unjust."

The first had a bit more action (The Bride's battle with the Crazy 88s was the greatest fight scene I ever scene in cinema). Further, the music was far superior. I did not think it was possible, but there was a 3-minute stretch where my eyelids started to get a bit heavy. On the positive side, the blood and cursing in Part 1 was a bit over the top; I actually think I could get my wife to see part 2. I also loked the film noir treatment in Part 2. Finally, I have always admired David Carradine and he does not disappoint. One thing I'll say, Uma Thurman was impressive both in acting and her mastery of the martial arts. Can you imagine Julia Roberts as the Bride (I can't do that. Where's my cigarettes???!!) Ms. Thurman deserves an Oscar Nomination. Is Ethan Hawke out of his gourd to fool around on her.

As in his other work, Joss Whedon uses an intricate mix of genres, high drama, action, mystery, humor, and character driven plot to draw the viewer into his world, and then keep the audience on the edge of their seats for the next two hours. Serenity is scifi for the thinking person, where the knuckle-whitening action is there to serve the development of its characters, and the laugh out loud moments let you catch your breath almost in time to gasp in shock. At the same time, the story works on the deeper level of analogy important to all great scifi, commenting on the human need for freedom, for family, for something to believe in, and the willingness of heros to sacrifice themselves for those ideals. Whedon weaves these threads throughout his story, and then trusts his audience to be able to enjoy the action and the deeper significance at the same time. Truly, a rare cinematic treat. '

S'Possibly the only time in Hollywood history that a film sequel measures up to (or, in some ways, surpasses) the original, Francis Ford Coppolla\'s "The Godfather Part II" (1974) will go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time. With his masteriece, "The Godfather" (1972)properly rewarded by audiences, cirtics, and the Academy, Coppolla set out, in very short order, to both provide a follow-up and a prequel that would do the original justice. To that end, he hit on all cylanders. Possibly the most difficult job for the director was to cast an actor capable of giving the same sort of understated, yet powerful performance that garnered a much-deserved (whether he wanted to accept it or not) Academy Award for Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. He struck absolute gold with a young Robert DeNiro. Deniro, as young Vito, was so good, and so convincing that he was able to win the Best Supporting Actor Award while hardly uttering a word of his performance in English. THe tale begins in the present and through the use of flashbacks, allows the audience an in depth study into the makings of a family business and the lenths at which the heads of the family will go to both obtain and protect their power. AL Pacino leads returning original cast members (Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale...) through the sequences that see the seventies version of the Corleone family dole out heavy doses of vengeance and retribution to all who have and continue to cross the line that interferes with the family\'s "business." All of the principals are again exquisite but I personally was held rivited by the flashback scenes featuring DeNiro as an honest, hard-working immigrant who learns, through his exposure to the reality of the streets, that he must take control of his situation if he is ever to realize his ambition. A fantastic picture from beginning to end and well worth endless repeat viewings. In an era that is less character based and more special effects driven, we owe it to ourselves the indulgence that these sort of classic films may give us. Novels come to life are far more engrossing than the sort of comic book characters that are feasted upon by the audiences of today.'

The importance of the movie lies not in 100% accuracy, but in the real story of a young Nations' fight for independence. It shows the heart and soul of the men and women who sacrificed everything so you could live free today. With all the crap being generated in Hollywood today, nothing more than eye candy, it was nice to be treated to an interactive experience, where what was being said was as important as what was being done. Any American, with a sense of pride in their Country, will be able to watch this movie and be proud of their heritage."

I think what makes this comedy a good one, is its excellent cast from young to experienced. I'd probably have to point out Jon Lovits and remarkable Rowan Atkinson as the highlights in this movie. Whoopi Goldberg was ok, but her role didn't have really funny parts. It seems like the producers of this movie cast Rowan Atkinson in the condition that he would play Mr.Bean in it, and it's obviously typical Mr.Bean material you're laughing at on this movie. Wayne Knight also did a great job, and his character's personality, was also very close to the character of Newman in Seinfeld, which is what he does best. Overall, this movie is an entertaining family comedy, with some really good parts."

And I thought it did a fantastic job of portraying high school life as it really is, which many movies miss the mark on. I would consider this a chick flick, with porn stars. It really is a teenage love story, and yeah, pretty much a carbon copy of Risky Business, but in a heavy time of remakes, if there is going to be one, it might as well be a good one, and this is."

S'The only movie involving sports that ever interested me because it was so much more than that. A wonderful tale of the underdog all the way around on an off the basketball court. Gene Hackman does his usual stellar job of acting and giving us a very memorable character. Barbara Hershey also does a very believable job as his love interest. But the best performance of all was Dennis Hopper cast as the pathetic, washed up alcoholic father of one of the players. Absolutely excellent job - the best I ve ever seen from Hopper. The story, the music and the era are definitely compelling. I misted up from the start since, on a personal level, it really reminded me of my father. That was in great part due to the fact that they filmed the championship game at Hinkle Field House on the Butler University Campus (Indianapolis, Indiana) where my father attended college in the early 1950 s. So, of course, when the call went out for extras one of my cousins and I naturally answered it. Oh, yes, I m in Hoosiers even though you couldn t find me with a microscope! LOL!'

S'This movie shows the saddest history we will ever know. It is the realization that millions of innocent human beings were murdered. I believe it also portrayed how people were incredibly weak to a hidden, sick power (Hitler). Thus, we should be extremely thankful that we live in a diverse and free society. We will never know the true horrors of what these people went through. Sometimes we tend to forget how lucky we are, and it makes me realize that everyday we live is a true blessing. It was a truly sad movie with a most powerful message. The music, composed by John Williams also added to the emotion of the film. How he ever came up with such a composition is purely ingenious. When it was played at my school, for the rememberence day assembly, people gathered around the string students who were playing it. It was a silent and sad moment I will remember for a long time. '

S'This may be the best movie I ve seen all year and I m certain it s one of the best roles of Kevin Kline s career. First the superfluous stuff; gorgeous sets and locations as well as good costumes and a believable trip in the Wayback Machine to the 1970 s even though, we re talking boarding school uniforms and not the flashy, trashy polyester clothing from that era that those of us who remember it all grew to loath (you guys know who you are because you are also probably the only ones who got the Wayback Machine reference). Now, for the more heady aspects of the film - this is obviously one of the better-written and well-directed films to come along in a great while in addition to being one of the more moving and meaningful. It managed to address the often forgotten subject of ethics and in a very straightforward, intelligent and very basic way. As to acting and the aforementioned great job by Kevin Kline I will say this; he managed to convey with mere facial expressions what some actors could not with volumes of verbiage. I m convinced he s one of the best talents we have in the seasoned actors category. Emperor s Club was well worth the price of admission as well as the price of a rental a few months from now.'

S"Girl, Interrupted is based upon a true story written by Susanna Kaysen (played by Winona Ryder), who is falsely accused of being crazy. Placed in a mental institution, she is confroted with the desicion of her life. She must decide on whether she wants to get better, or to spend her life being insane. The only thing standing in her way is the controlling, sociopath, Lisa (played by Angelina Jolie.) Director, James Mangold, has been critisized for the movies flat plotline, and inability to transfer the book into a movie. I agree that the films plot took a different route than most flicks, but to say it had no plot at all is an understatement. Those that say it had no plot, probably didn't understand it. With Ryder co-producing and starring in the flick, how can it go wrong? Not to mention other incredible performances by Angelina Jolie, Whoopie Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Clea Duvall, and many more. Lets face it, we all can relate to feeling a little crazy sometimes..okay, maybe not as crazy as some of the characters eating grapes off of the wallpaper, but crazy in some sense. This movie is a MUST-SEE, and definetly deserves this 5 star rating!! Copyrighted 2000 Kris10 R. Lee "

S"Forrest Gump is THE GREATEST MOTION PICTURE in the history of American cinema. Every other movie should be compared to Gump and then be determined if it meets the criteria of what a good movie is. Gump has every possible type of genre in it and at the same time has one of the most simplistic story lines ever. The acting is wonderful, the story is great, the cinematography is extraordinary and director Robert Zemeckis is one of the most brilliant directors in motion picture history. He is also one of the most overlooked directors in Hollywood today. He is able to give us movies better than that of Spielberg yet does not get much recognition. To think that it was the same man who brought us Back To The Future I, II, III, Death Becomes Her, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump, Contact and the soon to be released What Lies Beneath and Cast Away is truly a master Filmmaker. When I found out that Forrest Gump was number 71 on the AFI's list of 100 movies I very disappointed. How could the best movie of all time be at number 71? Then I finally realized why it was at number 71. It turns out that the list was made by idiots. I don't think that there's anyway that Tootsie is a better movie than Forrest Gump. Now I'm not usually one to go about and write my opinion on something so strongly but what really made me mad was reading a review about Gump on the IMDB by Ben Morgan. He seemed to hate the movie yet his review had nothing but good things to say about it. He starts off by saying, Surely Forrest Gump must rate as one of the biggest dupes of all time. Quite how the marketeers managed to pass this off as a great film is beyond my powers of reason. Yet he goes on to say things like: I would put this film into the same sort of class as the Wonder Years -What's so bad about the Wonder Years. It's a great show. The cast is good with Gary Sinise very good as Gump's Vietnam Sergeant. Sally Field is well cast as Gump's mother the effects are very nicely added the soundtrack is predictably well chosen given the period of time it covers It's little more than a period piece chronicalling American Life across three decades and how it affected one man, namely Mr Gump -No sh*t Sherlock. And what really, really made me mad was when he said: In years to come the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction will be looked upon much more favourably than the over-awarded Forrest Gump. I doubt it highly buddy. What is it about Forrest Gump that's so special to some people and yet so fake and cheesy to others? What do these other people consider to be a good movie? Tootsie?? Perhaps the reason that Forrest Gump is such a good movie is because it has this certain mood to it. This sort of magical feeling that stays with you for a long, long time. A feeling of knowing what it was like to live through the decades of American history and seeing just how foolish and loving the world is. I am proud to say that Forrest Gump is an extraordinary movie that changed my life in the way that I see movies and all I can do is feel sorry for the people that didn't like this movie because they're the ones that are truly missing out.

S"This is an absolutely fantastic film that was made in 1975. it stars Al Pacino as the main character Sonny - he's trying to rob a bank helped by his friend Sal in order to pay for his male lovers sex change. He had everything planned out (or so he thought) until he finds out that the money had already been removed before he had got there. So he decides to hold the bank clerks and manager hostage and the situation becomes desperate. The local police, led by Sergeant Moretti (Charles Dunning) try to get the situation under control, but because of Sonny's charisma, the general public who are outside support Sonny and the whole thing becomes a media circus. You do feel yourself willing Sonny and Sal to be ok and to live happily ever after, especially when Sonny's wife and male lover become involved and you think they are going to get away with it. But it ends so tragically. This is a timeless film and really shows Al Pacino's magnificance as an actor and the script is amazing. If you are a fan of Al Pacino and you haven't seen this, I urge you to. "

S'One of the best horror/thriller movies of the 90s. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal the Cannibal Lector, and Jodie Foster who usually annoys me does a great job as the inexperienced but determined Agent Starling. This movie comes back to haunt me occasionally, because a friend of mine does a funny-but-also-upsetting imitation of the scene where the guy says, She puts the lotion in the bucket If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, you should also check out a great but lesser-known movie called Manhunter. It was based on a book (called Red Dragon ) written by Thomas Harris the same guy who wrote Silence of the Lambs. '

I'm glad I went last weekend, and felt ashamed I didn't know more about the million people systematically slaughtered during the mid-nineties in Rwanda's Holocaust of sorts. The lesson in the movie is why is makes sense for the UN and its supporting countries to intervene during a major international crisis, which happened too little too late in Rwanda. It's easy to relate to the family that the movie centers around, and seeing all the modern day conveniences in most every scene do much to defeat myths people have of lifestyles in Africa. Big props to the heroic real-life hotel manager who is excellently portrayed by Don Cheadle in the film."

Just look at all the different versions of this story, Chariots of Fire, Rudy, Rocky, Raging Bull, on and on the list could go even to such stretches as It's a Wondeful Life (he's an underdog). You make a film with a fella whose never gotten a fair break in life who scrapes his way to the top to win and you've got yourself a winner. Of course it didn't hurt that this film had some of the best actors of our time in it like Gene Hackman, Dennis Hopper, and let's not forget the lovely Barbara Hershey."

S"I'm a bit late in coming in on this, but I count Boys Don't Cry as among one of my favorite films. It is raw, powerful, disturbing and heartwrenching. Hilary Swank was amazing and totally deserved the Oscar! The supporting cast was great as well, from Chloe Sevigny as the just-as-confused lover of Brandon to Peter Sarsgaard as sociopathic killer John Lotter. The first time I saw it I wasn't too sure, but after watching it a few more times, I really got into the story. The fact I used to live just over an hour from where the real Teena Brandon was murdered (I now live in Omaha) hit close to home. Seeing the movie helped me become, well, obsessed with the real case. I've been to Falls City, I've seen the house Brandon was murdered in, I've been to her grave in Lincoln, it just blows your mind that something like this happened in America in 1993! The story is more along the lines of a racial lynching in the South in the 1920s, but it is real, it happened right under our noses in late 1993 as we were sitting in theaters, stunned and watching Schindler's List. Yes, this movie might be very uncomfortable for many to watch, but it's such an important film for the time we live in. If you can't handle it, then you must have a problem with reality. It's not freaky stuff that goes on in the film- Teena Brandon really DID dress as a man, DID date women and have sex with them, DID get her pants pulled down and she WAS raped and murdered for no good reason! You can't make that kind of stuff up, folks. People just need to open their hearts and minds a little bit to realize there are still people in this country to this very day who are harassed, beaten and even killed because of who they are. Does the name Matthew Sheppard ring a bell with anyone? He and Teena Brandon will go down in history as tragic martyrs of the gay/transsexual rights movement."

The cast gave an unbelievable performance. Doug Hutchinson was amazing as Percy, the little a**hole, and by the end of the movie you just had the urge to strangle him. Tom Hanks, as always, gives an astounding performance as Paul Edgecombe. Bonnie Hunt was very good, too, as Paul's wife. David Morse was great and I give him two thumbs up for pushing Percy around and nearly beating the crap out of him. Sam Rockwell was so hilarious as Wild Bill. Barry Pepper as the young gaurd on E block. Michael Jeter as the inmate who befriends a mouse. And, of course, Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, accused of murder, but can give life with the touch of his hands. I loved this movie. The good and the evil in these men of E Block was brought out in a marvelous way. If you loved the movie, read the book."

I made a right choice as this film is amazing. Sarah Polley (Go) gave a very tender and emotional performance of a young woman dying and trying to do things shes never done before during her final days on earth. I can understand why she didn't make the choice to tell her family as she didn't want a pity party, but if you don't well-up as she makes a tape for her two children for their Birthday each year right up to the age of eighteen, then you missed a very sensitive part of the film."

S"Again, Steven Spielberg has triumphed. He is a shockingly creative man, to take one war and create two masterpieces, emotionally charged, star-studded, brutally realistic, sparing no expense. This man makes beautiful movies. A wide range of people can enjoy and appreciate this movie--Veterans of this war, veterans of any war, students studying wartime, children of veterans, adults who knew someone who knew someone who died in the war, etc. This movie epitomizes the unbelievable sacrifice made time and again by our countrymen to keep our country and this world free. This movie has the power to make young people of peacetime appreciate the turmoil of people their age in wartime. Superbly acted, as Spielberg makes sure all his films are, though Damon's part is comparatively small, it is remarkably memorable, his fresh-faced youth almost painful to see amongst such rubble and conflict. As he speaks of better times with his dead brothers, it is heartbreaking. Tom Hanks, one of the acting greats of our time, delivers an Oscar-worthy performance, and I believe he speaks to the nation when he tells Private James Ryan to EARN IT. "

S'This movie was really funny. You know how you see a commercial for a comedy, you go see the movie, and you realize that all the funny parts were in the preview? This is not one of those movies. The whole thing is good from beginning to end. Great Characters, Great story.'

S"Spielberg's epic masterpiece about one man's discovery of his conscience amid the horrors of the Holocaust. Filmed in B/W to evoke the contemporary films and newsreels of the day, Schindler's List immerses the viewer in the Holocaust experience. Unrelentingly brutal, the camera never flinches as the Nazis demonstrate evil on every scale. Watching this film would be a depressing experience, were it not for the final scenes which movingly portray Oskar Schindler's magnificent legacy. Superb performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes, combined with camera work that will be studied in film classes for years to come."

S'I find it interesting that the only people who have commented negatively are a: linguistically challenged, and b: desire more action. Next time rent a playstation game folks. This is one of the top ten movies of the last ten years, and a brilliant adaptation of a complex novel. I think a good case can be made to put this movie in the top hundred all time, maybe top fifty. There are no flaws here. '

S"He really did win for the quality of the movie , I'm still in awe in how he strung together all that information seamlessly. At the end of the movie I felt really betrayed by the media who never covered these things and uses up news time by interviewing other talking heads on their opinions. Who cares? how about some facts! "

S"A winner. Traffic is not for the faint of heart. You'll be on the edge of your seat from beginning to end as the story unfolds. Who's a good guy? WHo's a bad guy? Who can you trust? Will we ever see a Supporting Actor do a better job than Benicio Del Toro? Who dangerous is the drug trade? Who's shielded from it? If you've ever been a user, you should see this movie. If you've ever known a user, you should see this movie. If you've ever had a child, or think you might ever have a child, you should see this movie. And, make sure you know who you can trust."
