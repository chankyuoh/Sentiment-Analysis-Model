S'A 1.5. I will give it an extra half point because Gigli at least did not hurt the mentally disabled person he kidnapped. othewise this is flat out boring movie. the dialogue is awful. the plot is stupid. Even though I do not think that Jennifer Lopez is a great actress, i have seen her act better in other movies. she was not convincing as a tough hit woman. Even Ben Affleck came on a talk show and said it was not a very good movie. Glad I only spent 99cents to try out this one.'

Watching a movie where half of the time nothing happens and the other half of the time... nothing happens!! The plot was nowhere to be found, the acting so poor that you could throw up (except for Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) and an unseemingly desire to believe that all Scandinavians start and end their sentences with ja, ja, ja or nej, nej, nej . Let me tell you, I live in Sweden and watching someone mispronounce our language for over an hour is not my idea of a good time.'

The women looked like what I expected them to look like and whats up with the confederate flag? I tried to watch it because I heard it was so exciting, but I feel asleep on lap 20! I think to enjoy Nascar, you need to be intoxcicated, and I felt that these drivers were trying to hard to act like tough guys. Hey buttholes, stop wasting our precious fuel and stop calling yourselves athletes. If they're athletes, everyone who drives a car, truck, or a bus is an athlete! When is the last time you looked at a bus driver and thought that this guy is the Michael Jordan of bus driving? Never!

S"This is perhaps one of the worst action movies of all time. First of all, it is so removed from the premise of the original Mission: Impossible series that people wouldn't even recognize it as a sequel were it not for the title. Second, the plot is as predictable as they come: a bad man wants to threaten the world with a virus and the hero has to stop him, plus the girl is in danger; give me a break. Third, there is a truckload of slow-mo action scenes that might look good in the first minutes, but then they become tiresome since the amount of them has to be seen to be believed. Fourth, the action scenes are so over-the-top as to be ridiculous: Hunt (Cruise) can avoid bullets and perform stunts so exhaggerated as to be utterly laughable. Fifth, the movie has so many plot holes and absurdities as to be completely irritating: whenever Hunt has to infiltrate the bad guys' team, he wears a mask and can impersonate anyone, even people who were never seen before, or who are taller or fatter, whatever. At one point, one of the bad guys is killed because Hunt makes him wear a mask of himself. Just imagine, Hunt was carrying a mask of HIMSELF! How's that for deus ex machina. And what about the virus that is transmitted through blood in certain scenes, then suddenly is supposed to be airborne 'cause otherwise the plot wouldn't work? Pathetic. Sixth, the movie copies left and right from superior movies; most of it is pale imitation of Bond movies, and the rest is taken from some Hitchcock's classics or superhero movies (yeah, Cruise is also so strong in this film that he could rival Superman). All in all Mission: Impossible II is one of the worst summer movies I've ever seen in my life, and should be avoided like the plague. "

It is not lack of good effects, or dialog. I was just board. The film was not anything like what I had expected, and I felt it was a mockery of what might be. The entire film has a wholly surrealistic quality which I found very bothersome, and the end is anticlimactic with a major let down.'

S"It is almost impossible to watch a movie objectively. The viewer brings with him/her, consciously or not, expectations and personal feelings which it is absolutely impossible not to apply to what he/she is watching. This is as it should be. A film I love, others may hate. A film I think is one of the worst ever made, a lot of other people may enjoy. I'll give you an example: I think The Blair Witch Project is one of the worst ever made! A lot of other people enjoyed it. See how it works? I, too, heard the hype. I couldn't wait to see this movie, and actually the first two times I tried, it was sold out. I finally had to go to an afternoon matinee. After I saw the movie, I was more confused than annoyed. I had heard it was scary , terrifying , and so on. Had I seen a different cut of the movie? Maybe I fell asleep without knowing it and missed the scary stuff? So I went to see it again. Then, once more, on home video months later, JUST to make sure. Nope. Still not scary. To me, anyway. It's a simple idea, and would seem to have the potential to be scary: 3 young student filmmakers went to Burkettsville, Maryland, formerly (This is not fact, but fiction invented by the makers of Blair Witch , though Burkettsville itself is real)called Blair, to make a documentary on the Blair Witch, a settler in colonial times by the name of Elly Kedward who supposedly practiced witchcraft. After being exiled from the Blair settlement to die in the woods, she apparently caused a plague to wipe out most of the children in Blair. Hundreds of years later, she is believed by some to still be roaming the woods, causing mayhem and horror aplenty, including inducing a crazy hermit who lived in the woods in the 1940's to kidnap some children and kill them in his basement. They interviewed various locals, then set off into the woods. They became lost. They were victimized at night by strange sounds and someone or something that made little piles of stones outside their tent. One of them disappeared. The remaining two were victimized some more, then they went to the crazy old hermit's abandoned house, dropped their cameras and disappeared themselves. Their footage was found several years later, pasted together and this is what we are watching. This is all well and good. It even has creepy potential. Obviously, something about it was frightening to a lot of people, so what I am about to say is my own opinion, and should not stop anyone from checking out this movie if they are interested. I thought the whole thing played flatly. I found the three non-actors playing the students irritating. They bicker, scream and swear throughout, with no variation on the theme. Despite the implications of the little piles of rocks found outside the tent each morning or the stick figures found hanging from trees, I did not, personally, find these things threatening. If these three jerks were that hot to find out who was putting them there, why not turn off the lights in the tent and stay awake, watching? The noises heard at night in the woods were nebulous, at best. Anyone who has ever gone camping will tell you that the night woods are full of all sorts of strange sounds: breaking sticks, limbs falling, things moving around, even cries that sometimes sound human. I won't complain, as some have, about the jerkiness of the camerawork, because to be fair this is supposed to be raw footage shot by people who were walking through the woods and just filming each other. What I will comment on, though, is the stupidity of the notion that, in the extremity of their terror, ...alone, lost, hunted... as the girl in the funny knit cap so famously intones, her nose running into the camera, even kids as moronic as these would keep filming. Were this as authentic an experience as the makers of this borefest would like us to think it is, these dorks would have dropped the cameras and just started running until they either found their way out of the woods or just keeled over! I will say that the last ten minutes or so of the movie, when the two remaining wonks find the murderous hermit's old house and go inside has a certain amount of tension in it, though considered after the fact, the tension is caused almost entirely by what could potentially happen, rather than by anything that does. That, to me, is the big problem with the whole movie. It represents an hour and a half, give or take, of missed opportunities. And just out of curiosity-since this film represents three dimbulbs shooting footage of their every waking moment while lost in the woods over a three day period, why is only one of them seen going to the bathroom, and then only once? Wouldn't schmucks like these show their limited wit by taking every opportunity to sneak up on one another with the camera during private moments? Would have made the film more interesting, at least for me. "

Not only is it unfunny, but also painfully crude, with predictable gags about (snicker) MASTURBATION (snicker) and people that stick flutes up each others' asses... What? It resorts to recirculations of the already wothless gags of the original, and continues in its predecessor's path of the dehumanization of women. The glorifiaction of almost pre-adolescent behavior is extended into a sequence praising, in essence, the male predeliction for pornographic voyuerism of lesbians, and exhibits reluctance among the boys toward homosexuality- but they'll do anything to watch two girls together. There's nothing sexy about anything in the film, but there is offense on layers. The worst insult to women since Road Trip ."

S". . . I don't even know where to begin. It was so bad that if they make a sequel, I'll protest. This is the absolute WORST movie I've ever seen (to be fair, I haven't seen Gigli ). I liked the video game, so I gave this movie a chance. There were SO many things wrong with this movie. Where can I begin . . . 1) They automatically assume that a bunch of teenagers who have never touched a gun in their life can become expert at the use of semi automatic weapons and be able to handle the recoil upon picking one up. 2) Gratuitous breast exposure should be at least limited to less than 3 times in a ten-minute span, unless it's a pornographic film. 3) Why is the 15th-century captain's log typed and bound in leather? Or did the captain just have really good handwriting to write in Times New Roman, 12 point? 4) Of course all Asian girls know martial arts and is so in love with America that they'd wear a tacky outfit of the US flag, I do that all the time . . . seriously, what were they thinking? And that's just the beginning of my rant. I can't believe that someone had to first, conceive this idea, THEN think that this was a GOOD idea, THEN find someone else who thought it was a good idea to make the film.

I was looking forward to snuggling in early and watching some of my favorite actors and actresses. I was also looking forward to laughing a great deal. Suffice it to say the movie was a complete joke, one that was not funny in the least, however. I have no idea who talked these skilled actors into participating in this movie, but they should have given their salaries back to pay the production company to burn the film. It's not worth renting, trust me."

I used to like Will Farrell, but now after 29 movies over three years it has become apparent how one-dimensional and unoriginal he really is. He's the same character in every movie, and most recently they have all been bad movies. Nicole Kidman was at least a little (very little)likable in the movie, but she drops in my opinion -- guilt by association. What was she thinking taking on this role? This was one of the worst movies ever."

S"It boggles the mind that the vast majority of people posting ratings on this website rate this worthless piece of celluloid junk a 4 or better on a scale of 1 to 5. The formulaic script and shockingly pedestrian direction (especially for the Director of Das Boot) are bad enough, but the dialogue is the capper: Clooney's last line in the film (shouted at a wave) is one of the most laughable in film history. I loved the book, but the translation is terrible. Completely missing from the film is the very interesting way in which the storm's development was followed and tracked by meteorologists. Instead, the film creates a false and terribly underdeveloped story about a weatherman who does nothing more than point at a computer screen and say wow. Also lacking is development about the Navy rescue divers (although I found that story to be somewhat distracting in the book). In sum, this translation of an excellent book ended up being a schizophrenic mess, filled more with insipid and flaccid love stories than the drama that drove the real life event. I strongly recommend that if you are a thinking person, even one who really enjoys a great bubble gum flick as I do, do not even waste a buck renting this garbage on dollar night."

It was far to easy to tell when it was Aiden, or Samara in the possession scenes, and I didn't think Rachel's acting was particularly good at any point in the movie. The special effects in this film are pretty much what you got in the first one, no surprises there. There are two good effects moments, though. The deer attacking the car (Why didn't Rachel just listen to Aiden and keep driving?) and the bathtub scene (Why didn't Rachel listen to Aiden when he said he didn't want to take a bath?). Those two scenes were the highlight of an otherwise dull and unremarkable film. Skip it."

S"A most vulgar and offensive exploitation film. An anti-semitic slasher flick with Wes Craven overtones. Like most faith professions of contemporary Christianity, this nonsense focuses almost exclusively on the cult of the personality of Jesus, emphasizing his identity as God made flesh, while shortchanging his more valuable significance as agent of divine providence, redeemer and prophet, devoting about five minutes of the 144 minute running time to his teachings. This extreme anthropomorphizing falls just shy of blasphemy and the larger moral message gets lost. The movie's unrelenting obsession with cruelty and brutality is a cheapshot, opportunistic ploy to satiate the American moviegoing public's worship of gore and carnage. In this, Gibson is exploiting what is referred to in the synoptic gospels in a circumspect fashion, as the central issue, scripturally speaking, is not the human suffering of Christ but the redemptive process of which it is a part. But Mad Mel's telling of the story is more in the Freddy Krueger vein, apparently a cynical attempt to optimize box office receipts. The result is a heavy-handed, ill-advised reliance on shock effect that actually tends to desensitize the viewer after about fifteen minutes. As the prime focus of the film is the masochistic flaying/cruxifiction spectacle and the lack of affect by most of the participants, the characters are insufficiently developed and there is a shortage of significant human connection in the film. The characters become mere cardboard cutouts and the film has a cartoonish feel to it. As a result, the acting isn't even worth talking about. Hence, the film is emotionally vacant, as sensationalist torture crowds out the human ethos. The depiction of Jews is especially offensive, as the Pharisees are seen as being exclusively evil and vicious, totally without redeeming qualities and justification for their actions. The position that Jesus was crucified for blasphemy, iconoclasm and rabble rousing, three crimes very justifiable for extreme punishment back in those days, is given cursory reference and discounted as mere negative windowdressing. This is a perpetuation of medieval stereotypes that is grossly intolerant, atavistic and irresponsible. In addition, the presence of that Wes Craven-like Satan figure was also troubling: firstly, the Satan image was depicted as a woman, which is an example of typical RC misogyny that is akin to typical RC anti-semitism; secondly, the evil image was shown only within the manic Jewish rabble, further underscoring the implied anti-semitism of the film; thirdly, the extension of the Satan imagery to the demonized children theme (seen in the children berating Judas and the bald midget held by the Satan figure during the torture of Jesus) was most negative and serving of no defensible narrative or scriptural purpose. Mad Mel also tries to take the Romans off the hook for their culpability in the Passion. Pilate, a brute who was recalled from Judea due to the excessive carnage he inflicted, is portrayed as a contemplative, conflicted Goodguy caught between the demands of duty and moral conscience. This is totally at odds with historical accounts. Even the Roman soldiers who grossly abused Jesus are mostly pictured as loutish functionaries merely following orders. As Mad Mel subscribes to a conservative form of Roman Catholicism, it follows that he's attempting here to sanitize the record through revisionist denial. This movie was also marked by simplistic comparison/contrast. All Good vs. All Evil, Good Women (the two Marys) vs. Bad Woman (the Satan figure), Good Child (Jesus Christ) vs. Bad Children (mentioned above). This is an example of the reductive black and white Manichaean thinking of Catholicism, a primitive way to apprehend existence that figures prominently in the movie. The film was also bore a notable inaccuracy: as both versions of Jesus Christ's final words (found in Matthew and John) at the moment of expiration are uttered in the film, this critical moment is contradictory, inauthentic, and hence, unscriptual. There were several depictions of typically hokey Catholic magic in the film: the destruction of the Temple, the reattachment of the ear in the Garden of Gethsemane, etc. Yet, perhaps the greatest shortcoming of this turkey is the lost opportunity for moral ascendance: this movie would have been a prime moment to spread the valuable Christian teachings of love, tolerance, mercy, grace, forgiveness and redemption, yet the film was seriously lacking in these themes. If anything, a few of them were given the bum's rush near the end of the flick while repulsive liberties taken in earlier, extended scourging scenes were obviously considered more important to the story. In this, the great tale of deicide is pervaded with a sense of surgical detachment while being devoid of any palpable moral uplift."

There are a few that are OK, but this isn't one of them. The special effects were bad, and one could tell that the budget was all spent on Snipes because the cars that blew up were always old cars off by themselves where the shots were easy to control.

S'Talk about a boring, pointless, disappointing movie! I mistakenly thought that Girl, Interrupted was going to be a moving, inspirational story about a woman confronting serious mental illness. Instead, the main character (played by Winona Ryder) has no legitimate reason for committing herself to a mental institution, and viewers are subjected to watching her pathetic, self-indulgent behavior as she finds herself among the crazies. Even worse- the movie drags on and on, and I feared it would never end. I started feeling suicidal myself during the last third of the movie and only watched the rest because my husband wanted to see the ending. You have been warned!'

Long before it was over, I was hoping to be one of those stories you hear about where a bus in Mexico collides with another, or perhaps hurtles off a cliff. I knew how Oedipus felt when he blinded himself--and all he had done is slept with his mother; I had to sit through the length of this absolutely worthless drivel passing itself off as entertainment. I honestly don't understand why this movie was popular with anyone other than the most dedicated masochists."

A movie ad-libbed by a class of 3rd graders would have been more entertaining, and one would at least have been able to understand where the writers were coming from. The whole plot of this movie revolves around two moronic stoners trying to figure out what happened to them the previous night; they can't remember because they were incredibly high and wasted and stupid. I can only assume the film makers went through this exact process after they woke up and found out they had produced this abomination. Even people (including myself) who enjoy movies that are So Stupid, They're Funny will find themselves nauseated and insulted after even brief exposure to this comedic black hole. I hope that those responsible for inflicting the world with Dude, Where's My Car? are very, very sorry. And poor. And covered with honey and fire ants. "

Lets think, they are making the devil look like some sexy woman. That is absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't want to watch a movie like that. For a start, the devil is far from attractive. Like charmed, these producers have made the dark side look attractive. You want to know what the real devil is like, well for a start he is the ugliest monster in existance, secondly he hates all of humanity's guts (and that's Biblical fact). He was a murderer and lier from the beginning. Yeah, it may seem cool having this beautiful woman make the devil look beautiful, but if anyone were to really give their soul to the devil for some sensual pleasures, they will pay for it in a big way, for eternity too. It is not worth risking your whole eternity over, just to get a bit of pleasure on this earth. You want to know why the devil tries to tempt people, because he thinks everyone is stupid enough to fall for it. Because in reality, you have two choices. You can keep $1 and pay a trillion dollars (have your earthly pleasures and not be accepted into God's Kingdom), or you can pay $1 now, which will hurt, but get $1 trillion dollars back (give your life over to the Lord Jesus). What one would you choose. Judging by that movie, I know what the devil would want you to choose (keep the dollar, loose the trillion). This is not to push my beliefs or to frighten or offend anyone, these are just my thoughts on this movie. Plus it seems people arn't judging this movie on it's content or it's morality message (which is terrible), they are judging this movie based on lust (because they think the woman was attractive)."

The movie doesn't just switch gears halfway through, it mutates into a really really bad vampire movie (not that I've seen many good ones, but man, this one is probably one of the worst). If you like Tarantino's stuff, this might be alright. Otherwise, I'd suggest a new movie."

As Roger Ebert once said, you can tell a movie is bad when you look at your watch. Then look at it again. Then shake it to see if it's stopped. I would go on about historical inaccuracies.... This movie couldn't seem to find a time setting. There were Native Americans doing MARTIAL ARTS. And the Wolf itself, some kind of giant [badly done] CGI badger with armor obscuring you from seeing it (when you finally do see it, they use the standard hiding the monster bit for most of the film). If I had to say anything, the photography, settings, and costumes were beautiful. But when the only way you can validate a film is the costumes, you know the plot and chaarcters are lacking. I was completely surprised. I expected a sensible, well-done French Film. What I got was a nonsensical American-style blockbuster."

The cold actually stay out. Randy Quaid actuallly sacrifices a useful man to save a son that may, or may not, be alive. He actually finds him, and when he knocks on the door, they get looks on their faces as if the cold decided to try to get them again. Sela Ward stays with a child when no one in their right mind would. People actually freeze instantly. People try to get to safety after they discover the flood waters have frozen. It's odd that Sela, Jake, and Randy all survive in this awful movie. The main family always survives in a disaster movie of this magnitude. I will say this: The scenes involving the three guys monitoring buoys of the coast were great. I wish they were in this movie more."

This is why I tape high-quality TV (Frasier, Cosby Show, Happy Days) more than modern comedy movies. For a movie called Sugar Spice, there isn't much sweet about this movie."

Armand was not blonde, is not blonde, and never in his everlasting life will he ever BE blonde! He is russian, with long red-brown hair. Pandora never died, she still lives out her existance hating and loving what she is. Where as Lestat's mother, Gabriel? She should have at least had a MINOR part in the movie! This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. Every copy should be burned. "

S"Nothing could have prepared me for the torrent of bile script spewing from a greek epic of dire, sluggish, tedious and asinine proportions as this joke of a farcical Hollywood movie. Of the many bad films I saw this year this one topped the pole easily. It made Van Helsing look like a cult classic, Gothika a Hitchcock inspired film and that loathsome Cold Mountain a historical epic in the same league as Gone with the Wind and believe me, it wasn't. One film has to take home the prize for worst film of the year and surely Troy is it. It's times like these that you can see the importance of actors having some classical training as the majority of them were reciting their lines as if they were reading from a rostrum camera and at their worst auto-cue cards. Brad Pitt looked somewhat like a greek god, but Achilles he wasn't. He looked like a californian surfer preparing for a friend's greek themed Halloween party. Orlando Bloom is gorgeous, but let's face it, he can't act if his life depended on it and relies on the supporting cast to save his talent. The women's roles in this film were awful they were simple eye candy, damsel in distress playthings with as much depth as a merky puddle. Diane Kruger looked the part of Helen, but she failed to make her character more than two-dimensional and at times believeable. Eric Bana as the almost courageous and heroic Hector didn't engage me, he bored me silly. The fight scene between himself and Brad Pitt was good, but what shocked me the most were actors in that scene watched Hector's death as if they were watching a bug killed in a bathtub, there was no sincerity of a valuable loss at all. Peter O'Toole as the father of Hector and Paris showed the younger generation of actors how you play a classical character and prevented this film from tumbling further into horrendous tedium. At times I felt as if I was watching a film students graduation movie. As a member of the audience I wasn't pulled in, I was thrown out. Simply put this film is TERRIBLE!"

Perhaps the stupidest film to come out in a long time, the idiots who gave the go to make a sequel out of the originally lame 'Baby Genuises' ought to be tarred and feathered for wasting millions of dollars on such worthlessness. This movie, like its predecessor, has no humor- nor does it have any real meaning to it. This movie, in short, is a disgrace almost as bad as the total failure of moviedom from years back: 'The Jerky Boys Movie'. Perhaps the only positive thing about this movie is that it can't possibly be as bad as 'The Jerky Boys Movie'. But it comes fairly close."

That movie is a lot of garbage because it is crude, sends a signal to young people that popularity is what to live for and sex is a cheap and dirty thing, plus it tells young people that swaring is cool. I remember there used to be an old song called American Pie and it was a very good song which even glorified God. It is amazing how sin can stuff things up. Sex when used properly, is a very sweet, clean, good thing which signifies spiritual and physical bondage between husband and wife. It is not to be used out of marriage or anything other then husband or wife."

S"Seldom do I get so much pure viewing pleasure from a film in the cinema as I did while watching 'The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'. For those of you unfamiliar with Wallace and Gromit, they are the loveable clay motion creations of Nick Park: Wallace, a slightly gormless, unfailingly polite bachelor inventor, and his long-suffering intellectual canine partner, Gromit. Their relationship is like that of an old married couple, and the adventures in which they get entangled are utterly incongruous with their domestic natures. In this film, they are running a humane pest control service and find themselves dealing with a beast, an enormous mutant were-rabbit, who is endangering the prize vegetables grown by the local villagers to exhibit at the annual fair. The film is unapologetically silly and deviously clever, paying homage to King Kong, Jaws, and a whole rake of early horror flicks, revelling in the hackneyed characters that populate such films - the superstitious village yokels, the semi-crazed preacher, etc. It would have been easy for the filmmaker to drop in these references in a heavy-handed fashion, sticking out as anomalies from the flow of the story, as was the case in places with Shrek, but Park's touch is so deft and natural that they add entertainment value for adults and children alike, albeit for different reasons. There is also a love interest, although, don't expect to have your emotions wrenched. Other than that, I am giving nothing away, as there is a twist in the tale which you may not see coming. Just watch it. "

I loved it for a variety of reasons, but I really think that 'baseball' was just a vehicle for the expression of sorrow, regret, and reconciliation between a father and a son. Watched it maybe a dozen times, the last 20 minutes always chokes me up. We all look at our parents differently when we get older. We usually get an opportunity to mend fences. Kevin Costner's character had no way to reconcile with his dad, except thru the field of dreams. James Earl Jones is great in a supporting role and provides many, many great quotes in the final scenes of the movie. "

S'A dark tale of a young man who finds just underneath the lovely top soil of his beloved home town, Lumberton, lies a very, very, sick and twisted side. One he cannot fathom. Until the day he goes to pay a visit to his father in the hospital and on the way home finds a severed human ear. He takes it to the father of his good friend from school who happen to be a detective. The detectives daughter gives Jeffrey some tid bits of one of her fathers conversations about the case. This leads Jeffery to an eclectic older mysterious woman and through her he meets a drug addicted sadist named Frank. A dark and Erotic murder mystery begins to unfold around Jeffery and soon finds himself to be a major player in the sinister game. Blue Velvet is a master work of the phenominal director, David Lynch. One of his most noteworthy works and well deserving to be. Was nominated for best picture and best director in 1986. Very surreal and beautiful with great symbolism through out. Another masterpiece from artist David Lynch. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!'

One part tells the story of a young Vito Corleone, wonderfully played by Robert DeNiro. The other part chronicles the rise in power of Michael Corleone, perfectly played by Al Pacino. If you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and rent Godfather and Godfather: PartII. It will be a well spent afternoon."

I really felt for John and the demons that he delt with his mental illness. I felt this movie showed a real brutal honesty about how hard it must be to deal with schizophrenia.Ron Howard won a much deserved oscar for his directing. I would recommend this movie.

S"One of Pacino's all time classic permormances. A simple film set largley on location, ie the bank, the film which could have ended up turgid and monotonous due to its long periods of inactivity and its very simplicity ends up vibrant and gripping due soley to an all time great performance by pacino. The phone call sceans act as a kinda microcosm of the film. The camera zooms in on Pacino, escaping the madness of the crowd outside and the media hoopla as Sonny talks to his two wives . Again, had we been watching a lesser actor the sceane would have dragged and been extruciatingly dull. As it turns out Pacino makes the sceans among the greatest moments in cinama history, IMO. Acting masterclass. "

S"Of course, like any other documentarian and activist, Moore misses the point from time to time, but for the most part, his three features were on the money. Fahrenheit 9/11 did make too much of the Unocal issue and was slightly off-base when it came to the number of children of Congressional members in military service (Moore said it was 1 when the number is actually around 4, which still means that less than 1% of Congressmen/women have children at risk of being in military harm's way: the interesting point Moore made in this regard is that not a single member of Congress he approached in terms of recruiting their children would give him the time of day. What great leaders we have who are willing to make the same sarifices the common people routinely do!). He did belabor some points that should have been left alone, but he did point out some damning facts that did not paint GWB in flattering colors, and for good reason. It was great that Moore included the now-famous eight minutes of GWB reading My Favorite Goat: here, the so-called Leader of the Free World who's supposed to be so vigilant against terrorism and stalwart in protecting the nation, blankly sitting there like a bump on a log after he was informed that our nation was under attack. Now, that's leadership and decisiveness! Actually, he sat there, blinking like the deer caught in the headlights, immobile, paralyzed, obviously totally unsure of what to do. He looked heavily medicated, as well. Another very interesting point was how members of the House of Saud and other prominent Arabs, through the intermediary Mr. Bath, coughed up millions of dollars to bail out young GWB's failed oil prospecting projects. No wonder GWB refuses to go after the real enemy, the true sponsors of terrorism. Also interesting that the bin Laden and Bush families are bigtime players in the Carlyle Group: obviously oil and money are thicker than blood to these people, that the financial interests of the Bush family are more important than national security and the safety of American citizens. It's not terribly surprising that GWB dropped the ball in terms of getting Osama or eradicating his apparatus and instead went off half-cocked on this lame Iraq distractionary adventure. Anyone who pans this film and accuses it of being fictive and grossly inaccurate is obviously one of those brainwashed dimbulbs blindly allegiant to that moronic draft dodger and fool currently drooling in the Oval Office. Get with it rightwing touchholes: Bush is a total loser."

S'Ok everyone gather round\' while i tell u a tale a tale of the legend of John Rambo. Rambo (Stallone) was a vietnam war hero veteran, who during war saw all his friends get annahilated. He had no family and nowhere to go, the war vets were thought of as baby killers and other vile crap. Rambo went to visit his old budy that survived but wouldnt you know it, cancer ate him down to the bone, so having nowhere to go he heads for Bumtown (Portland) on his way there he gets picked up for vagrancy in a small jerkwater town by the sheriff. As u can guess Rambo didnt want a ride outta town so they booked him for resisting arrest. they take him in and "F" with the wrong guy, he escapes and heads up into the forest and hides out up there while everyone and their dogs (literally) hunt his ass down. But big John is hard to find (War experience) well i dont want to give away the ending so go see this if you havnt, before Rambo comes for you!!! "he drew first blood".'

S"Released in 2002 and directed by Alexander Payne, About Schmidt is a dark comedy that has a very flat, intentionally plodding pace. The film almost exclusively centers around Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) who is forced into retirement from his job as an insurance actuary. Schmidt quickly finds that his wife is essentially a stranger, and he turns to sponsoring an orphan boy in Africa named Ndugu. After his wife unexpectantly dies and in search of entertainment and change, Schmidt purchases an RV and begins a trip to Colorado to try to stop his daughter (Hope Davis) from marrying a waterbed salesman (Dermot Mulroney). Arriving in Colorado, Schmidt is faced with his future in-law (Kathy Bates). Viewers looking for more action miss the point of this film as the humor is intentionally dark and dialogue driven, and the pace is intentionally plodding to match the aura of Schmidt's new life. Though the in-laws are supposed to be portrayed as eccentric and over the top, Bates' persona was a bit excessive; however, Davis as Schmidt's no frills daughter was wonderful. What makes this film work is the casting and effort of Nicholson who can portray a man boiling inside, yet never erupts save within the anonymity of his letters to Ndugu which are the highlights of the film and move the story along. The bottom line is that About Schmidt is a cerebral black comedy that is not for everyone, but a must see for those who like the genre."

From then on he meets three presidents, serves in Vietnam, Is awarded the medal of honor, speakes infront of thousands during a war protest, gos to China and plays in the world ping-pong championship, uncovers the watergate scandle, starts the biggest scrimpin company in America, is one of the original investors in micresoft, and runs for three years straight across the country. Obviously he has an exciting life, but after advevture always returns to his home in Alabama. An epoc film, and historicly Amazing.

This movie takes it all to another level and makes the family so abnormal that it makes the Aadams family look like the Waltons. The catch phrase means more than what you are watching in the movie (the catch phrase is look closer for those of you who don't know). It means when you go home, when you out, when you somebody, something, look closer. There is probably more to them than meets the eye. This movie is a remarkable achievement, and I am happy that so many people saw the beauty in it that i did. To enjoy the movie more, try watching it really late at night. It becomes so much more over whelming. I recomend this movie to every one. If you don't like it, it's still entertaining in it's own twisted way."

I think it also speaks about kids today, the post modern sense of fashion, in trying to create a look of your own and to build ideas of your own from what has gone before that is really important in looking at why society is forming the way it is. I didn't think the film came across as too biased in favor of the characters, they were often made to look rediculous. This film reminded me of the sense of confusion that we often feel as we form our identities thoughout our lives. It also mocked the collector and I think you could read social commentary in that as well. We live in such an affluent society that we can collect things, most of us don't have to worry about day to day survival, we can amass luxury items and keep them on shelves forever expanding and we can even build our identities around them as well. I read a lot into this film and I think there was a lot of meat to grab on to, lots to think about and to talk about. That to me is the mark of a really good film."

S"I rented this movie last night and watched it with a friend, and we were moved to tears at many points, we felt the pain of the victims, we felt the hatred of their adversaries. I don't understand the raters on here who insist on making this an Oscar or a religious issue. For God's sakes, these were real human beings, regardless of what religious, political, or ethnic background you have. These people suffered and that suffering was portrayed in a fair and painful light. I am not personally Jewish, but nor am I blind to what happened before and during WWII. I cannot believe that some people would twist a beautiful, moving, inspiring film into a political and religious outrage! So Spielberg got an Oscar -- so what? After watching this film, I think he damn well deserved it."

S"My favorite movie ever!!! Mel Gibson gives an outstanding performance as Benjamin Martin, a father of seven children, who keeps family top priority in his life. He is from South Carolina, a state which is going to war with the British. Benjamin doesn't want war; he wishes there were some alternative to it. However, he ends up fighting the British, along with his oldest son, Gabriel, to take revenge for the death of Thomas, one of Benjamin's sons. References are made to slaves, i liked the way those conflicts were resolved in the end. Colonel Tavington got what he deserved in the end... I really liked that. The restoration of order taking place was great, when his house was being rebuilt. Overall, an awesome adventure and journey dealing with American History. Packed with great storylines, action and suspence. Rush out and see it."

Robert Carlyle and Ewan McGregor are both superb actors and no less so in this film. Excellent soundtrack too, I listen to it all the time, includes Iggy Pop's Lust for life and Underworld's classic Born Slippy (which if you listen to long enough and loud enough you'll feel like you're on drugs!)."

It isn't a film for the uneducated masses who like Hollywood slop delivered to them in neat little packages. It makes you ponder and listen carefully to what is being shown on screen. It is complex and multi-layered in its approach. The acting of David Hyde Pierce is exquisite and his character is definitely the heart of the piece. Catherine Keener and Mary McCormick are also great in this film. Steven Soderburgh is one of the most talented directors in the business and Full Frontal will some day be recognised as the masterpiece it really is."

S"Possibly the greatest film of all time, wonderfully written script that allows the viewer to see inside the heads of most family members, except the Don, played by Marlon Brando, who has an aire of mystery to him that isn't revealed until the Godfather Part II. The acting is superb on all levels, and the casting was done perfectly. Obviously modeled after Mario Puzo's novel, THE GODFATHER, but also contains elements of Milton's PARADISE LOST. The Don portrays a devil figure, cast out of his origanal home and achieves success in his new dwelling, also in that he is the head of an organization of men that he manipulates with ease. The Corleone Family is structured similar to that of the Army of Demons in PARADISE LOST as well. Being, without any argument, the best Mafia movie ever, The Godfather appeals to human interest in organized crime and violence. But the film is more than that, it provides a look into the American Dream of achieving success in the new world, by any means possible."

I have to say that it was incredibly refreshing to see an older male actor playing a role that reflects his age...someone who's married to an older woman his own age, who's retiring and dealing with being a senior citizen basically. The narration in the film is brilliant, because it's constructed through letters which the character writes to Ndugu, the child he sponsers through world vision. Those letter provide the funniest moments in the entire film...I was practically choking with laughter at some of the things he writes."

Since then I've probably watched it two or 3 more times and pick up more and more each time. It's a brilliant film. How I didn't see it from the beginning I don't know. The twists and turns this movie take. It really makes you pay attention and think, it's not a movie that you can flip back and forth to or watch while you're doing something else. Ed Norton-a fantastic actor. Brad Pitt-more than just a pretty face. I like to watch this when I'm alone so there are no distractions. "

S" Forrest Gump has always been one of my favorite movies, and I'm sure that 25 years from now, people will still be watching it, laughing and crying along with Forrest. I thought Tom Hanks was at his best here. His acting in this film, or any other for that matter, is so believable and intense. Never have so many subplots been fit into the big picture so perfectly. I really enjoyed seeing history through the eyes of a man who just sees things as they are and doesn't provide an opinionated slant one way or another. I thought that his analysis on JFK was simple and actually sort of funny in the way that he said it: Somebody shot that man while he riding in his car. His meeting with both JFK and LBJ was hilarious.... I got shot in the butt... . His love for Jenny makes for compelling drama, and his friendshp with Bubba (obsessed with shrimp) makes for some funny moments and some sad ones as well. He goes on to run across country, run a shrimp business, play football, and do anything imaginable despite having a low IQ. I loved how Forrest was so down to earth and nothing mattered to him but making those around him happy and honoring their memory when they died (Momma, Bubba and Jenny). A great performance by Sally Field as Forrest's Momma. Never before have I seen a movie that brought out all of the audience's emotions so well. This film is a classic!"

S"Who needs DARE when you have this movie?! The performances were awe-inspiring. The message of the movie was one of the most poignant I have ever seen. It is shocking and very disturbing, but important much like Schindler's List was. You don't want to see this stuff, but you need to in order to understand the world and what can be done about what we don't like. I wondered about the validity of the hospital scene, thinking that I can't imagine it would be legal to send him to jail instead of at least treating the infection. I realize the point they were making, but it was already made by that point. What would have worked even better is if the movie were longer, showing how the son got involved in hard core drugs in the first place. I showed this movie to my kids, while having to explain what I believe were the gateway drugs before heroin. They got the message I hoped they would, it feels good but the temporary good feelings are not worth the cost. Also, addictive drugs are addictive drugs, whether or not one is less socially appropriate than another. This movie made that point beautifully. We, as a society, shouldn't treat drug addicts as criminals either. It is torture and it doesn't solve anything in the process."

S" The Godfather was the first film that really portrayed the humanness behind the atrocious behavior of the Mafia. Before this film, the public was always fed the notion that the mob was a faceless, foreign group of monsters since the 1920's. Marlon Brando really fleshed out the character of Don Corleone; he commanded the respect of the people around him as well as the audience: a man who spoke quietly because he didn't need to shout to be heard! Al Pacino handled the part of Micheal Corleone with considerable know-how and his transformation was believable. But it was James CAAN's Sonny that was mesmerizing! Everytime he was on the screen, he left you feeling anxious and breathless because he played the ticking time-bomb so effectively. Everything about this film was sheer perfection from Coppola's direction to the costume design. I think anyone would be hard pressed to name a Mafia film that possesses as much gravity or contributed more to our fairly new found perceptions of Mafia life as this one does."

Provides a realistic sense of history, and why Americans took a personal stake in the races of a once-ridiculed horse. Likewise, it's easy to get caught up in the movie, as all the cast shines admirably. Based on Laura Hillenbrand's superb 2001 book. It's PG-13, but many age groups would enjoy it."

And bringing the series to its conclusion, Jay and Silent Bob. ALl five are great, and as the series goes on, the courser and funnier the movies get.

However, this film does not require the big screen to come through. The film is beautifully set, and extremely funny. This film is somewhat autobiographical, and the circumstances of the characters as well as their depth allow that to come through.

S'Cruise is good in this film but this is definitely Dustin Hoffman at his very finest. He creates for us a sweet little character trapped inside his own mind and as harmless and likeable as small puppy. In the process we also get a rare look into the world of autism and the frustrations family members and caregivers can come to feel. This is a movie with heart and soul - the tale of two brothers and coming to terms with emotions and situations you can t change. My favorite Raymond Babbitz moment is when he is standing in the gigantic window in the Las Vegas hotel room and looking out on all the lights. The shot is wide and from the back and Hoffman looks very small and alone. With his head tilted to one side he quietly says, Very sparkly, very twinkly. That to me summed up Raymond Babbitz very sparkly, very twinkly, and very much alone. What a great film.'

S" Schindler's List is probably the most authentic portrayal of the Holocaust you can get without being a documentary. Speilberg proved himself to be a director of the highest caliber and Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson give stellar performances that haven't been matched YET. But there a few things that really struck me about this film that are astounding. 1) The little girl's red coat- To some it symbolized the bloodshed of six million victims; to me it symbolized freedom. In the first scene she and the red coat appear, she is walking oblivious and unnoticed through chaotic streets like a little girl walking home from school without a care in the world but when she hides under the bed, her coat suddenly changes black and white. She has become a part of and is entraped by the dismal scene. When we see her again, she is on a cart, expired and headed for the incinerator- she no longer has to experience the horrors of what is going on around her. 2) Hitler is rarely mentioned and never seen in the film. He remains the unseen force behind all the evil that we observe on the screen; the result of the man rather than the man himself. 3) I have never seen death scenes more authentic before. The particular one that comes to mind is the female architect in the concentration camp. Did you notice how she bounced off the ground, limp and lifeless, after she was shot? This has drilled something home to me: I have realized how fragile and priceless life is and though we forget from time to time, we are NOT invincible. 4) The profound character study of Schindler and the effects war and death can have on someone. At the beginning of the film, we have a money-hungry, womanizing Nazi sympathizer who transforms into a compassionate, selfless philanthropist. I guess Anne Frank was right when she said I believe there is good in everyone.. I will always have a special place in my heart for this film and have not just observed this picture, but been completely absorbed and transformed by it!"

S'I believe The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever created. The movie was directed extremely well, it has excellent cast, and above all, it has brilliant and wonderful story. It is funny, sensitizes, sophisticated and has an astonishing end - every thing a movie should have. When I first saw this movie, I was very impressed, especially from its end. From that time, I manage to see it at least ten times and each time I saw it again, I enjoy it like I haven t seen it at all; I even see things that I haven t noticed before. I think that everyone should see this movie at least one time, and if you haven t seen it yet, go see it - I promise you that you ll enjoy every second of it.'

S"Man was this a good movie. Sam Mendes - first time director - he is the big thing for the future. He directed this marvelously, and came up with a well-crafted, brilliant, sad, movie. It's music is perfect, it's acting is perfect, it's script is absolutely brilliant, and Sam Mendes' directing is great. It thoroughly deserved its Oscars, and will prove to be a classic in 10 years time, most likely making it onto top 100 film lists all around the world, I would say it will be on AFIs. I bought in on VHS, you should too. See it. I found nearly NO flaws in it. Almost perfect. I watched this with an audience, and they laughed, they were shocked, this is such a great movie.

You absolutely cannot condone ruthless murders, but in Monster you gain an understanding of one woman's tactic for survival, a clear understanding of why she did what she did and most of all her universal search to be loved and accepted. Christina Ricci underplayed the character of Selby nicely and Charlize prooved that shes not just a pretty face by not only physically transforming herself, but mentally too. For the first time in a long time I can honestly say that someone rightfully deserved the Best Actress Oscar gong this year."

It's really difficult to get a sense of a movie in 45 minute pieces. Boy, am I glad I took a second look. This movie is wonderful. Narrated incredibly by Martin Sheen, the movie follows his character, Capt. Willard, as he goes further and further up the river into the jungles of Vietnam to terminate with extreme prejudice Kurtz a former military hero who has gone crazy. With tremendous performances by the entire cast, notably Sheen and Robert Duvall, Apocalypse Now allows us to see the many horrors of Vietnam and how the men who went there were changed forever. You definitely have to be in the right mood to watch this movie, but if you haven't seen it, make sure you rent it. The vivid pictures and wonderful camera shots created by Coppola and the great acting will make it worthwhile."

Sean Penn earned his Best Actor Oscar with his skillful portrayal of Jimmy, whose daughter is murdered. Jimmy is more complex than he appears at the beginning of the movie, and is not just a grieving dad. Penn's acting in this movie convinced me that he is the Marlon Brando of my generation. Tim Robbins is also deserving of praise as the psychologically scarred Dave, who is still trying to come to grips with a childhood trauma. Tim Robbins portrays Dave as a sensitive, but wounded, gentle giant. I agree with a previous poster who stated that Mystic River should have won Best Picture and Best Director. Mystic River posesses an immediacy that a dopey fable like Lord of the Rings sadly lacks."

I thought the movie said alot about life in general. that he was so worried about time and rushing that he would forget what was really important, was the people in his life, and when he was on the island he had nothing BUT time.

Odd-Job is still scary. Pussy Galore makes most A list actresses today look like cardboard cut-outs in comparism. "

S'Whether you agree or disagree with Michael Moore, democracy needs people like him, who are not afraid to question the actions and intentions of the people whom we give the power to rule our country. George Bush is supposed to represent all Americans, Michael Moore included. If Moore were to keep his mouth shut, he would fail in his duty as an American citizen.'

S'Anonymous (The fraud one) must be a British Subject. While this movie is a compilation of multiple stories from the Revolution, it has a good historical base. A very heart ripping movie, that should motivate any American to be proud of our forefathers. As a devout Constitutionalist, I found the scenes regarding the Militia and firearms ownership and use to be exceptional. A must see movie.'

The actors and actresses in it are as follows: Julia Roberts, Billy Christal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta Jones...Oh and the adorable Seth Green is in it toooooo!!!!Catherine Zeta Jones and John Cusack are the famous couple that split ^...and Julia Roberts is the sister of Catherine Zeta Jones, and Billy Christal is the man hired to get them back together and Seth Green is Billy Chrystal's assistant....it is very cute!! Did yall know that Julia Roberts was offered the part as Gwen, Catherine Zeta Jones' part.

S'Outstanding music movie. Sarah Share does a great job of walking the tightrope between glorifying and villifying the genius and self destructive bent of Shane MacGowan. You leave the movie not exactly sure what to think - will he be dead in 5 years? Will he go sober? Can he go sober and still be himself? However the story ends, the life he has lived to date is interesting to say the least... if you like the punk rock scene, and you enjoy the Pogues, you should not miss this movie.'

S"For me, Traffic is going to be my pick for the best film of not only the year, but the decade. Stephen Soderbergh took a large risk in making a film with a budget, with stars, and a RELEVANT story line, and to agree with another film critic, it is the best drama Hollywood has put out since The Godfather in 1972. The acting was superb, the photography (which Soderbergh shot under a pseudonym) was brilliantly shaky and colorful, and the plot was so wonderfully complex without going over the top that it is too much to explain here and do it justice. Benicio Del Toro and Michael Douglas are the real standouts in this picture, though nearly all other characters are just as complicated and lived in. Soderbergh, even before Traffic was released, was my favorite living director, and with this brilliant epic, he will surely become the same for others. For those who liked Traffic, I also recommend Soderbergh's cut and paste noir The Limey which used many of the same techniques, and it also featured the always lovable Luis Guzman, who in Traffic served with Don Cheadle as the comic relief, a witty live action Puumba of their silly duo. I loved it, every frame."

Probably the only movie i like to watch with Howie Mandel or Ted Danson. I was amased how young Dennis Franz looks. People who like the movie Dumb and Dumberer probably would like this movie. Some of the movies that are considered bad are the funniest movies. It is a movie you got to relax and watch.'
