S"This rating is based on the movie itself, and not on it being a religious movie being rated by a devout and loudmouthed Atheist. SImply on it's artistic merit, THE PASSION simply wasn't any good. The acting seemed forced and unemotional. As for the story, I noticed several errors. Just to name a few: The flogging went on too long. I believe the Romans practiced the forty save one method of flogging (I.E. 39 lashes) I counted well over fifty lashes. The Romans didn't pound nails into the hand, they went through the wrist. Yes, I know it showed Jesus tied to the cross as well, but this wasn't done, as it increased the time it took the poor victim to die. Peter's three denials could have been taken as one, having all been lumped together as one incident. In reality, they were propably more spread out. And if Jesus was already dead, why did the blood and water come out with such force? Dead, no Heartbeat, No force pushing out the blood and water. Not a very accurate film. Mel Gibson should be ashamed at himself for putting out this dreck."

But please..haven't we had enough of stupid trollops hanging around in bras and panties in a cabin saying, What's that noise. 'I have a great idea, I will put a rain coat over my scivvies and go trapsing around the pitch black campground with a flashlight that has no batteries and follow that sound of someone screaming and being bludgeoned.' These movies frustrate me more than anything. I find myself screaming, You dumb naked tramp, don't go into the abandaned outhouse, don't you freakin' see the six by six foot pool of blood you are standing in and your boyfriend's head on the stick in front of you?!

I just didn't buy it. It seemed to me that the assumption was made that the apes would follow the path of human development but would just retain some of their more hostile animal traits. I felt like the apes got ripped off here but I guess I was the one that got ripped off for shelling out 5.75 for this pitiful excuse for a film."

S'I really HATE Annie both the production and the kid. Unlike Mary Poppins which I liked in spite of some of the musical numbers, the musical side of Annie just seems to work against the story. I kept wanting to say SHUT up and tell me something. Also, if I want to see a bunch of kids sing who can t sing I ll accompany a friend or relative to their child s next grade school choir recital. Basically, I think a lot of shallow points all merged here to create one large annoying movie experience for me. Things like Annie s hair (comb it out you drip!), Carol Burnett s part (arrrgh what a jerk and not in a funny way), the grating songs (ahhhh, my ears), the lack of much of a plot (I stopped caring about her plight early on), the rushed pace (calm down and tell a story, will ya!). I was sorry I took a chance with this back when it was first released and wasted money on a ticket. No fear that I would ever rent it even for kids.'

This thing was just a non-stop oh my god is this cheesey scene after another. When he's rock climbing and jumps 20 feet and DOWN to his right and slides down the rock face until he suddenly grips a protrubing pebble?!!? Then he decides to turn himself around and hang for a couple of minutes while he stares off into space with a Goddamn I'm cool look on his face.

Michael Moore may be a smart man, but he doesn't depict himself properly when all he does is piss and moan about one problem instead of adressing every aspect of it. FOR ONE THING, Michael Moore only adresses 4 countries in the world about gun violence. Look at some places in the middle east. Gun violence is worse there than America. We ought to go there and try and help those poor kids there. Michael Moore also spins some things out of control. SOme of the links he makes between gun violence and what causes it.......Jeez. In my opinion, What causes gun violence is poverty and overcrowding which also causes mental instability among many. "

S"I saw a sneak preview of What A Girl Wants, and here is my review. This film contains the usual plot of girl wants to reunite with her birth father. In this case, the father lives in a posh mansion in England, and the girl is coming from a hip community in America. She meets dad, wins his trust, falls in love with another boy, gets into a catfight with the boy's other girlfriend, and the film is over. That is what to expect (mostly) from this film. Amanda Bynes should not have signed on to do this film, because it's even below HER (oh my god..did I just say that!). It's really that bad. It could've been better. It's not Amanda's fault though. It's the screenplay, and the material that the actors are given. Both Colin Firth and Kelly Preston aren't given adequate screen time to make their cases, so it seems like a one-dimensional storyline for Amanda's character. Plus, the storyline wanders off far too many times, and there are a few too many limp one liners that could make everyone in the audience nauceous! The boy-meets-girl storyline may appeal to teenage girls, but the rest does not click. What A Girl Wants isn't."

S"I recently made a huge mistake. I went to see Blair Witch 2. I saw the first one and it was pretty good, so I figured I might as well go and see the sequel. It was horrible. The characters were weak, there was no plot, no motive, no anything. I've never fallen asleep during a horror movie before, but this time I found myself struggling to stay awake. The movie made absolutely no sense. Words simply cannot express how bad this movie was. It was a waste of $7.00, and I would'nt mind if the people behind this movie never did anything else ever again. If you thought the ending to the first Blair Witch was bad, wait until you see this one. I can't beleive I actually waisted my time and money on that garbage. Movies like this discourage me from ever going to the movies again. I've never been more pissed off at a movie than I was at this one. I'm just going to stop talking about it before I get angry. BLAIR WITCH 2 SUCKS! I beg others to go out and see this horrible movie so you can give some reviews about it. It would be nice to know if other people can also recognize bad movies when they see them, so I don't end up thinking I'm crazy. "

The ending was so disappointing, after the movie was finished I felt nothing, just like I had wasted my money to see a bunch of minldess overdone action pieces and CGI. I like mindless action but I atleast deserve characters that I have some care about and a plot a little less ridiculous. Rental only...discount rental."

S"The word that comes to mind when describing this film is MISCASTED. Christina Ricci seems absolutely disassociated from her character. Often there is no passion behind her speech, even when her role is that of a severely disturbed person. She is obviously supposed to have bulimia, but the mood swings and the intensity that come with them are no where to be found. Autism would suit her portrayal of Amanda better then Bulimia. In a word- wooden. Jason Biggs, who plays Jerry, is about as authentic and comfortable in his role as the actors in the late-night paid programming ads. He simply cannot play the part of a intellectual, troubled, writer. He acts the same as he did in American Pie- an eager, befuddled, socially inapt young adult trying to become comfortable with the world before he is even comfortable with himself, but then it was the source of comedy and in Anything Else it merely detracted. Not one of his scenes or bits of dialogue seemed authentic or believable. Both Biggs and Ricci may be able to, in part, pass the buck to Woddy Allen's screen writing. The pretentious verbiage seemed like suitable dialogue for Dawson's Creek: College Years. It was a cheap tool of bad writing: instead of developing the characters into intellectuals just have them use big words and small little ones. Additionally the film waxed philosophical obnoxiously. It wasn't subtle at all, but as overt as guy nudging you going Do ya get it? Do ya get it? Existentialism! If only this film had contained any interesting existential themes worth noting it may have been more bearable. Instead Existentialism was reduced to name dropping. Jason Biggs pondering on the fact that as humans we have to confront our own mortality with a sprinkle of Sarte and a dash of Camus is neither insightful or effective. Nor was Amanda's eating disorder very well done. From the beginning it is obvious that she has an eating disorder, but that is really all that can be said about it. None of the characters acknowledge it, nor does it really serve any purpose in furthering the narrative or making the characters and drama more complex and compelling. The only reasonable conclusion seems to be that the audience are the only people that know she has it which, if it's trying to, doesn't build to anything. There are many such loose ends in this movie. While the majority of the movie was terrible and the irony crap, I must say that there were some good things. Danny DeVito, playing Jerry's manager, was the best actor in it and he did a good job; he was funny, entertaining- he was Danny Devito. There were also some great gems of dialogue, mostly spoken by DuBelle (Allen). Just some useless trivia (not a spoiler)- at the end when Biggs says I guess Dubelle's seminal joke was that: Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. That stopped clock bit is actually from Whitnail and I, unless it was first written somewhere before that movie (1987). The juxtaposition of that with Dubelle's lines right before is cerebrally comical. "

S"This was written by Dr. William Pierce http://www.seanbryson.freeuk.com/articles/jews_white_slavery.html Steven Spielberg's pseudo-historical film about a 19th century mutiny and massacre aboard a Spanish slave ship, Amistad, and the subsequent trial of the Black mutineers is being praised by the reviewers. Spielberg, one of the wealthiest and most successful of Hollywood's Jewish film makers, is also being praised by his kinsmen in various so-called human rights organizations for using his propaganda skills to sensitize White, Gentile audiences to the horrors of slavery and make them feel just a little more guilty for treating non-Whites so badly in the past. What the film doesn't mention, of course, is that Spielberg's Jewish kinsmen owned many, though not all, of the ships involved in the 18th- and 19th-century Atlantic trade in Black slaves and, in fact, played a very prominent role in bringing Black slaves to America. The film tends to steer one away from blaming anyone for slavery except White Gentiles. This bit of misdirection is interesting in light of the fact that Jews have been dominant in the slave trade since at least Roman times -- especially the trade in White slaves. Jewish slave dealers followed Caesar's armies everywhere -- into Gaul, into Germany, and into other northern lands -- eager to buy as slaves all of the captives of the Romans -- especially the female captives.

S"My last review of this film was so offensive that they couldn't post it. This sick testament to racist American values left me feeling so sick and cynical as to nearly provoke violence in my otherwise pacifist spirit. This is the worst film that I have ever seen, after Phantasm 2 and countless other sequels, horror schlockfests, and exploitation films . This film insulted my soul. Its paen to romance is a farce in itself, with such flat dialogue that I cannot even remember it to quote it... The female lead, Miss Beckinsale, has managed to feign likability eben in the face of her despicably empty foray into quick sex in public, something that I KNOW is viciously empty in itself. But the act is romanticized! The cinematography and unnecessarily sexy setting alone are ridiculous. When Mr. Hartnett inevitably lays down his racist, war-mongering life for the good old USA, I was moved to laughter. The constant stream of racial slurs delivered by our heroic boys are evocative of the wonderfully propagandist flicks of the war era itself, and their stupid patriotism is so empty as to insult anyone who has ever laid down their life for any country. This is the perfect antithesis to Arlington National Cemetary, to Saving Private Ryan , to the young, innocent dead! I have never felt guiltier for my nationality, not when standing at the Smithsonian looking at the tribute to the Japanese oppressed by our people in internment camps during WW2, whose plight was caused by those empty fools who share the morale professed by this sick, sad film, not when reading of the conditions of the slaves whose oppression was enforced by our former presidents. The film left me so ill as to wish the death of the touching conclusion's little boy in Vietnam, being brought up in the vein of his dear daddies, doubtless to become one of the crouching, slurring monuments to blind racism, running through the grass with an automatic weapon and a desire for the blood of an unseen foe, and certainly not enjoying the kill 'em all glory that his fathers managed... When he is blown apart by an unseen mine, I wonder what Mr. Affleck's character would do... Erect a monument to his heroism . Sick. This film is a sick, war-loving void, whose romance will doubtless result in the philandering of countless impressionable young girls, and whose racist violence is eerily reminiscent of the modern national sentiment toward the Afghanis... It's okay to hate, kids! It's okay to kill... Okay... This is the most insulting, most vapid, most vile film in my realm of experience. Blasphemy, cruelty, madness and publicity. A bloated, painted devil-whore."

I guess they decided to rely on gratuitous boob shots rather than put some actual thought into the making of this movie. I will admit that there were some (few) suspenseful moments..but about halfway through (if not sooner) the movie becomes so predictable and the ending is so over the top it is ridiculous.

S"Where to begin? Dark Water looks like a fun, scary, summer movie from every trailer that is shown, and I admit that I looked forward to seeing it. But now that I have sat down and taken the hours out of my life to watch the film, I feel like I have wasted a part of my life for this movie. To be frank, Dark Water is a boring, and un-scary film. I thought of this movie as being along the lines (in scares and suspense) of the remake of The Ring, but I found myself disappointed in what I watched take place on screen. I'm not sure if it's just me, but dirty water gushing out of a faucet every 5 min. is not what I call scary. Obviously I did not like this movie, and nearly the entire theater who saw the film with me felt the same way. Many people immediately got on their cell phones and called others saying how bad it was, and one woman said to her (husband I'm presuming) that she felt that she had been ripped off, even though it was a free screening. From what is shown in the trailers (panic, glass breaking, and water gushing out in every direction), all of that happens within the final 15 or 10 min. of the movie. What is worse is that the first hour or so is so dull and boring that you loose interest almost completely by the time the, do I dare say, fun, events occur. In the beginning, Dark Water seems to be a slow paced, and sad drama. Not at all a scary/suspenseful thriller. The ending is bizarre, and pointless. The mystery of what happens is unclearly solved and we are left thinking what just happened?. The director takes his time setting up the movie (drawing out divorce, custody hearings, looking through the apartment for a good 20 min., walking around the halls, riding in the elevator, going to school, among many other things), and then when you finally care about what is happening, it is like he slams the book shut and leaves you disappointed. At one time I looked forward to seeing Dark Water beat the Fantastic 4 at the box office, because the Fantastic 4 looked even worse from previews, interviews and trailers, but now... now after seeing Dark Water in its entirety, I have to say to everyone wondering how Dark Water really is: Save your money. You will most likely be very disappointed in the end."

It was bad enough directing away question about what is oral sex thanks to Bill Clinton, now I have a kid asking what an Action Shot is. I guess after Klumps I should have known what to expect; heck, from Eddie's early comedy act I should have known what to expect.

The only part of the movie that was true to the spirit of the comic was HULK battling the tanks. The dogs were dumb. Letting Banner's father, the person he hates most, talk to him, knowing he'll most likely piss him off and make em change into the HULK and escape was dumb. Making the HULK change in the water tank, without having a way to contain him was dumb. The ending was dumb. The script was so dadpan. The split screens and the soundtrack was oppressive and out of place. How can you make the HULK boring??? I felt nothing for Banner, unlike Bill Bixby's character, who I really sympathized with. Thanks Ang Kee for destroying what should have been a great and excited Marvel movie."

What makes this movie bad is the pseudo-intellectual feel that virtually drips off the screen. I really feel that a lot of people saw this movie and despite its awfulness, believe that saying they like it is the sign of an intellectual. This movie desperately tries to be poetic and filled with meaning, but what results is dull, contrived, and utterly void of spirit.'

It did have one good character that I could relate to. Randy. The horror movie geek. Yea I can relate to him but he is such a tiny sub character only a few movie patrons even cared about him. I cried my eyes out when I watched Scream 2. I watched Scream a couple times just for Randy. Scream is sleak and well shot. Fairly o.k. acted but not a horror movie. This is more of an action movie than anything else.If you want to be scared DON T COME ANY CLOSER. If you wish to put your brain into cruise control and watch a tediouse time filler with a few whippdey doos in it COME RIGHT IN! OH YEAH!! I almost forgot this film is what brought about teeny bopper horror! Scream loses major points for that. Horror by Hilfiger...where is my gun?'

S"Everyone who rated this movie as great must really be truly blind. Shroomwoman is exactly correct. In the movie, Mr. Moore expresses how he cares for the victims of Columbine. About how scary the whole incident was. Mr. Moore made millions of dollars from this documentary. And how much do you think went to the poor victims of this terrible tragedy? $0. Suprised? Shouldn't be. Especially when he balmes all wealthy and rich people in America for the poor people's problems. Yet, he was the man who made millions and didn't give a single dime of it to anyone but himself. God, I hate hypocrisy. Anyway, this film, if you can really call it that, is nothing but Moore's own opinion mixed together with political views. And lies, of course. Mr. Moore visits a weapons of mass destruction facility as it is described in the film. In reality, it was not making any weapons, but satellites. He compares US gun violence to the gun violence in Australia, as well as other countries. About how Australia only has a few hundred vioent crimes while the US has thousands. Yet, then, you ask yourself, what is the population of Australia vs. teh US? LOL! Its little pieces and bits if information and facts that are left out of the movie. Just like the timeline of the US, that blames America for 9-11. That's right. Watch the movie and feel the disgrace in your stomach. I did. Mr. Moore is just a filthy liar, who is trying to brainwash you into believing his lies. Don't fall for him. Everyone who supports this film is an idiot and a tool."

I'm not sure which aspect of Battlefield Earth stunk the most - the inane plot, the overdone acting, the ridiculous makeup/costumes, or the pathetic attempts to create drama by showing slow-motion shots of glass breaking every two minutes. How did three otherwise respected actors (Travolta, Forest Whitaker, and Barry Pepper - who was great in Saving Private Ryan ) get themselves involved in such a worthless waste of time and money?"

S"I just saw an advance screening of this in Toronto, and I have to say it is without a doubt one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen. While I enjoyed XXX and found the Fast and the Furious moderately entertaining for a rental, I have to say that Rob Cohen has just proved himself as having one of the worst eyes for detail in the world... that or he simply does not have any other skill except pointing the camera and shooting. The first 15 minutes of the film shows good promise. It starts off with a bang and gives you some of the coolest fighter jet action ever. And in terms of the jet sequences, they are certainly some of the best I have ever seen. But that is the only saving grace of this film. If all you care about are the fighter sequences, you will probably enjoy this. But, if you have any brain for real military situations, science or even common sense, you will find this film to be about the stupidest piece of tripe you have every laid your eyes on. To give one example, at one point a pilot has to bail out of a plane (this is shown in the commercials). Any person with a brain would know that if a pilot bailed out, in a few seconds that pilot's plane would be nearly a mile away. However, this pilot ejects downwards and a few seconds later the plane blows up raining fiery debris over the pilot. Any person with a basic understanding of science would know that the heavy, metallic debris from the plane would be traveling faster in its original direction than the falling pilot, and since the plane did not blow up instantly, it would not be directly above the pilot. However, the debris falls in a straight line down onto the pilot. Another example is the fact that there are so many minor plot threads that have absolutely no importance to the overall story. It is like the writer needed to fill space instead of developing the original story and decided to just throw in a bunch of unrelated, undeveloped scenes. Instead of developing the main story (which was interesting enough) we get a bunch of little threads that never add up to a very interesting whole. These are just two examples of how badly thought out the script was. The list is actually endless and my friend and I spent the second half of the film just carving it up. Jamie Foxx is going to be thanking the Maker that he won the Oscar before this film was released. At least he can still ride on that success. However, there is not much for anybody else involved in this film to walk away with. Don't waste your money. If you want to see it, rent it. But there are much better films to spend money on. I'm glad I didn't spend a cent. "

Alex was a euro-trash fruitcake in bad '70s threads, and despite the inherent fruity factor, he still managed to be a rapist prick. I personally think he should have been caned on public television until he stopped screaming than brokered to a Russian porn ring and forced to serve fat russian men for the rest of his brief, AIDS-infected existence."

The film is laced with graphic descriptions of sexual activity, profanity, nudity, drug use, amoral attitdues, and tons of other stuff that shouldn't be in any movie.

I'm sure you were amused at one of your Rate-Its who believes that sexuality is the only thing that binds us humans together. That statement makes me want to cry for the poor unfortunate soul who lives a life believing that. The same writer also states that the human race is nothing more than cattle. Thank God... said writer can do more than Moo...he did give Quills 5 stars, which is about what a cow WOULD give it. Another comment from another writer states that Quills was about the writter Marque who wrote about his passions and sexual urges that in that time were considered wrong. Have I missed something or is it not still considered wrong to capture under age girls for sexual exploitation. I guess masturbating into a Chalice would not be termed wrong but is there anyone out there in Cyber Space who thinks some things are morally wrong? Another writer thinks the film represents freedom......and I ask freedom to do what??? Does the Rate-It not believe that any freedom carries the profound weight of responsibility? This is a pornographic film and its scary that our society today gives 5 stars to pornography all the while worshiping a Golden Calf they call, FREEDOM "

Just because the parents want to be entertained while taking the kids to this? If the parents want entertainment for themselves, hire a baby sitter and go out to see Bridget Jones Diary, but don't fill America's youth with foul humor even if it is 'sugarcoated'. Shrek was a dissapointment to say the least. The one good thing about it was the I'm a Believer remake, but again, that's for our own enjoyment, does a young child really care about Smashmouth or want a 'rock song' as their movie theme song? I would hope that the answer, even in our jaded world is still no."

Not in the way that PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE is, just so bad, it is actually fun to watch, but in a way that is actually painfull to watch. Disappointing from the opening credits to the closing credits. I can't believe George Burns, who is usually a rather good comic, would have agreed to appear in this peice of trash. If you are a Beatles fan, despite the title, I urge you to skip this movie. I have not had any respect for Peter Frampton since seeing this dreck. It is hard to take him seriously anymore. The only redeaming quality about this abomanation is the beauty of the actress who played Strawberry Fields, even though she couldn't act her way out of a plastic bag. When I first heard about this movie I was very excited, being a huge fan of the Beatles. The cast sounds like it can't miss. But, someone, in the opening two minutes, I knew this film would be bad. I can't believe just how bad it was. As a comparison, this movie makes SHOWGIRLS seem like an Oscar winner. And SHOWGIRLS is one of biggest disappoints in movie history. Whenever SGT. PEPPER is scheduled to be shown on tv (which is rare, thank god!!!!!), I turn off my televison, lest I catch just a glimpse of this travesty. There are not enough words in the English language, or any other, to describe my hatered for this god-awful piece of crap."

There was none of that humor that makes the Garfield comic strips so funny. No kicking the crap out of Odie, no humorous jokes about Jon, no nothing. This movie lacked substance, it really did. I would rather have lost the $8.50 I spent on the ticket on the streets somewhere rather than sit for an hour and half forced to watch this mess because I don't like to waste money. I hated this film!!! The least they could have done was make Odie animated as well then maybe they could have done some of funny things they're known for doing to each other. But, you could tell that this sh*t was low-budget. The acting was terrible, the set was terrible, the cast was terrible, the plot ridiculous (Odie gets kidnapped by a TV show host because he can dance and the guy wants him for a co-host and Garfield sets out to rescue him). At the end Jon ends up with Liz the vet. Now that would never happen in the actual comic strip. STUPID!!! I am really ranting here but I am actually a big fan of the comic strip, I own several books full of them, I've bought posters, the works so I feel I can really be a critic here. This movie did not represent what Garfield is really about at all. It was pathetic. The End."

The premise of the film is simple - if a love is pure it will never die which is reflected when Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) returns from the dead one year after his and his fiancees deaths on devils night. Eric seeks revenge on the persons responsible for their deaths and one by one kills off the criminals by their own trademark which leads up to a fantastic sequence between him and the big boss who ordered the deaths. It was tragic that this was Brandon Lee's last film - but that makes it even more special to watch as you get to see him in a spectacular film."

I give it five stars for the honesty of its portrayals of the various downward spirals of addictions to heroin and speed. Add dazzling and substantial direction and editing by Darren Aronofsky which really puts you in the head and wasted bodies of addicts to four of the most stunning performances I have seen all year. The result is a film to love and appreciate for its high quality and absolutely unflinching honesty. At one point, watching a drug addict shoot up in a car, I absolutely could not watch. Any movie that makes me squirm usually has performances that engage me so much I am moved beyond being lackadaisical. In, say, Scream by contrast its like Oh gee, he cut a stomach open. Kudos especially to Ellen Burstyn who can out-act nearly everyone else on the planet. Unforgettable as a diet-pill addict desperate for a shot on national tv. "

Renee Zellweger is very convincing as a young single mother - and the boy who plays her son is outstanding as well. I can't think of a single actor in the film who isn't particularly good - and thats rare. The movie runs along very smoothly and the music matches the tempo of it. It reflects that society now works too hard and often forgets that there are other things in life to think and enjoy. It also points out that in the workplace, you can never really know what people think about you. I love this film, when I want to feel soppy and realise that what I have in life is so amazing (my partner, our flat, and just about everything) and I am so lucky. "

Both accurate and intriguing, history came to life in all its costumes and turning an otherwise dull chapter of monarchy into a magnificent saga of sacrificial triumph. Elizabeth the Queen feminist-whoever would have thought."

S"This movie is an absolute triumph. The character collaboration and conflict is ingenius, every emotion played on, every heart opened, every thought explored. This is an incredibly responsible bit of filmmaking, wonderfully edited, divinely written. It prods into the human spirit as few others have done before it, trailing the life of boy/man genius Will Hunting. We see him in love, we see him in pain, we see him cornered, we see him forced to face his past, his present, and his future as an insanely gifted man. We see him interact with a variety of characters, including psychiatrists, bar buddies, childhood friends, fellow geniuses (with an explainable amount of contempt), and girls. He is both accelerated and hindered by his unheard of brain power, both good and bad sides of his talents are explored. Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, and Ben Affleck give performances comparable to Damon's own. Surprisingly, Casey Affleck, portraying the stupidest bloke in Boston as a foil to Will Hunting, delivers a performance to evoke both humor and pity. All involved in this movie deserve commendation. Watch it and watch it again. "

I feel it deserves a much higher placement on this RateItALllist because not only was it a riveting, interesting, timely film circling on an important issue, it was based on a true story and landmark legal case! And if any of you reading think I only really like it so much because I'm a big Julia Roberts fan, think again because I was one of the very few people who hated Pretty Woman. Actually I didn't think Roberts was good in any of her many films, except maybe Sleeping With the Enemy. - But in Erin Brockovich, Roberts really amazed me! She not only performed the part flawlessly, but she just seemed to belong to the story. She was one with the story and the spirit of the story. Julia Roberts deserved her Academy Award for this film."

S'This movie was absolutely fantastic. As a movie, a documentary, and a political attack. I honestly believe that anyone can appreciate it. There were times when he took cheap shots at Bush, or times when he made is point through innuendo and not a solid case, but no one ever said this film is supposed to be fair. Conservatives are screaming propaganda (which is histrionic because, with the above criticisms in mind, he still uses pure facts) But even if it is; I say its about time. After all, conservatives have a 24-hour propaganda machine called Fox News, which lies and distorts information, but tries to passs as a legitamate disperser of news. The opposition finally has a voice....the true lovers of democracy-true patriots finally have a voice! Hurray for Michael Moore for breaking down the Bush Barrier of lies and deception!'

S"This is truly a wonderful film. Perhaps the film can be criticized for being a bit too anthropomorphic; but even this characteristic only helps audiences to engage - and thus to more fully identify with these small and wonderful creatures. Unfortunately, there is now a disturbing 'political' trend, as reported in today's (September 13, 2005) New York Times. Both the film, and its diminutive heroes, are being heralded as a clear example of 'conservative' values. Conservative critics and commentators are seeing a variety of values and virtues in the film such as: 'the beauty of life and the rightness of protecting it'; 'a strong case for intelligent design'; 'most passionately affirms traditional norms like monogamy, sacrifice and child rearing' 'a winning argument for the theory that life is too complex to have arisen through random selection'; 'Some of the circumstances they (the penguins) experienced seemed to parallel those of Christians'. All of these values and virtues are perhaps laudable. But aren't these critics and commentators really missing the point? The film is an entertainment; and a great entertainment at that. But the film is about birds; cute and cuddly birds - but still birds, not people. As entertainment, the film attempts to tell a simple, albeit inspiring, story about the mating habits of one species of penguin. If the makers of the film had truly wanted to expand the film into a fuller depiction of conservative values, a further habit of penguins could have been included. There is one less 'cute and cuddly' example of social behavior which penguins are prone to use. Whenever possible, penguins will maintain a small hole in the ice so that they can easily enter and exit for feeding. Being creatures of the water, they can, of course, sense when sharks are in the area. The penguins intuitively understand that until the sharks' appetites are sated - or until they just leave the vicinity - it is not safe to go into the water. However, hunger is a strong motivator, and so, in order to solve this problem, penguins will, as a group, 'crowd' the hole. Eventually, the weakest of the penguins will be forced through the hole and into the water. It is generally only a short time, once the sharks have fed and left the area, that the stronger group of penguins can again go in and feed. Perhaps this is just one more 'virtue' that the 'political' conservatives have already learned from the penguins. "

If you're not interested in those things you may not get much from the movie . . . but you should. See it anyway & try to understand what it's all about. What it's about is as current today as it was way back when. Funny (or not) how history repeats. A film of this type, with this message will always be relavent, no matter which side of the political spectrum you prefer. I thought the movie was brilliantly filmed in black & white. I enjoyed the editing and camera angles. The dialougue is intelligent and, at times, quite funny in a low-key sort of way. There's more going on than meets the eye. Finally, the movie made me want to find out even more about the characters involved. If a film can make me pick up a book then it has done it's job."

Robin Williams' best role so far and a performance he will hardly ever surpass. Let's not forget that Peter Weir (director) is THE MAN behind this masterpiece. Many young actors went on to become well-known names after this movie. +The ending, which, as someone else has also written, is one of the best in film history (the only one that perhaps surpasses it is in Citizen Kane )."

S"There are some movies like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back that lower your opinion of humanity and there are others like Forrest Gump that can raise it. The beauty of The Pianist is that it can do both. Though this is a holocaust film, there are no concentration camps and it is all seen through the eyes of one man with long periods without dialogue. Much has been said about whether Adrien Brody underacted the part or not. I think he did a beautiful job and far from seeming detached from it all, he seemed more shocked and numb to me. If I had to endure what he endured I would probably mentally shut down too. The first part of the film was very hard for me. I had a hard time with Schindler's List and a few scenes in this movie proved very difficult and I'll admit I cried through most of the first half. After Szpilman loses his family, but has his own life spared, he goes on mental auto-pilot and just does what he can to get by. The last half-hour is very moving and makes all the violent scenes near the beginning worthwhile. The thing about this film is that it can do wonders for putting your life into perpective, if even for just a few days. After seeing this film, I realize just how petty most of our problems are in this society and how much we take our civil liberties for granted. Aside from being a beautifully made film, The Pianist sends a powerful message of just how much we have to be thankful for."

S'Forrest Gump is a beautifully directed film that deals with important contemporary issues. It presents issues of single motherhood, AIDS, mental retardation and advocacy. Forrest Gump is a great story of how one man with a very low IQ became very financially successful. It is a story of rough beginnings and great adventures. Forrest Gump represents the best of what a decent life can be.'

He's sent to a prestigious prep school and everyone doesn't think he's academically sound, yet he really is a genius. Everyone thinks the school took him for his equally amazing basketball ability. The friendship he forms with the intellectual writer William Forrester makes the movie a bit of a bildungsroman. I would emphatically recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. It is a classic in my opinion."

S"Bruce Greenwood didn't really play Kennedy very well in the movie, but the screenplay of the movie was excellent nonetheless. It moves very quickly without getting mired in detail, which is a tendency in movies that recreate actual events. It hit all of the strategic concerns revolving around the Missile Crisis. Really this event was the turning point in the Cold War. Policymakers came to grips with the fact that nuclear annihilation was a very real possibility with escalating conflict. Thirteen Days very accurately portrayed the myriad of potential solutions to the deadlock like war with the Soviets or a blockade. The Joint Chiefs wanted war while the civilian leadership was more cautious. If you want a peek at how official Washington operates, take a look at this movie. The movie portrays the high point of the Kennedy administration, one that has a decidedly mixed record (sorry Redoedo). He got off to a very slow start but I would say that this was his baptismal by fire. He played hardball with the Soviets after this. The Cuban Missile Crisis also really changed the whole dynamic of the Cold War. The realities of nuclear annihilation became a very real, tangible possibility. The US and the Soviets had to improve relations or else there would have been a nuclear exchange; something that wouldn't have benefitted anyone at the end of the day. So anyways, minus Greenwood's bad portrayal of Kennedy, I would say it's a great movie."

S"A great work of art by Stephen King. Brilliant, a Masterpiece. Very well written and thought out. The storyline is extremely tight & well constructed. This film should have won the Oscar for Best Picture but unfortunately it came out the same year as Forest Grump. Forest Grump won the Best Picture Oscar because it was oatmeal for the masses and could be digested easily. When I saw Shawshank Redemption in New York City you could hear a pin drop. That's how captivating a story it is. When the sadistic prison guard captain beat the new inmate to death the audience's eyes were glued to the moviescreen. The film speaks volumes about feelings of despair and hope. The Count of Monte Cristo would have been proud of Andy Dufresne."

S"It's always amazing to me how liberals always miss the point of this movie- even Tom Hanks disliked the character Forrest Gump. This movie is simply about your most basic Christian belief- about caring for your fellow man and doing was is good- about pursuing happiness in its rightful place. It parallels the lives of two characters Forrest and Jenny. Forrest- dumb as a bag of rocks- processes the realities of life in it's most basic forms no matter how challenging it became he always did what thought was good- what his momma told him. His journey from a crippled child to enlisting in the military and serving in Vietnam, having his best friend die in his arms is riddled with painful events that he turns into positive experiences by doing what is good. Jenny, his love, is also dealt a horrible plot in life being sexually molested as a child. Jenny is brilliant however and ends up going to Berkley living the fads of the era and embarks on a different path. She becomes consumed by fulfilling human desire that eventually consumes her and leaves her perpetually lonely. The point being made here was that human happiness is not satisfied with prurient satisfaction but action of virtue. That this appeal to universal human goods transcended human brilliance- that human happiness was part of something greater. In the end the dummy Forrest fathers a baby with Jenny that brings her only solace in life before she succumbs to AIDS. Though being the dummy the world however is Forrest's oyster where he attains an improbable wealth and happiness that he uses to continually do good. The essence of this movie is defining what is the pursuit of happiness- what is it to be free. Is happiness about satisfying simple earthly wants or is happiness about doing what is right and reaping the benefits? Liberals view the world in such a constricted box that they will consistently miss the beauty of a movie like this. But as Forrest says stupid is as stupid does."

S'Definitely worth seeing. Finally, a "Family" flick that doesn\'t put me to sleep. Like LOTR, it took a long time before film technology could do justice to it. It\'s a very imaginative story tht allows people to choose how much symbolism is involved. Supposedly, author C. S. Lewis based the hero (a lion) on a certain figure prominently featured in the New Testament. The acting was decent. I loved Tilda Swinton in "The Deep End." She plays a very BEYOTCHEE Witch with perpetual Bad Hair Days, which seems to put her in a murderous rage all the time. She does a decent job with her swordplay -- even with her skinny little arms. As I always say, the mark of a great actress is her ability to wield swords or to launch kicks. Take Julia Roberts or Jennifer Aniston, overated damsels; the only thing tough they can do is pout while smoking a cigarette. '

Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise playing a cocky, young military defense attorney. Kiefer Sutherland as Nicholson's conniving Lieutenant portrays the slimeball accomplice perfectly, and Kevin Bacon as the JAGcorps DA gets that part to a tee. Combine all of that with splendid direction by Rob Reiner and you've got the best courtroom drama since Inherit the Wind. Oscars? No. They don't give Oscars to movies that make you feel good about the military. But, after 9-11, maybe they should reconsider. "

S"How disturbing this film is. Ten years after it's release, it can still keep the viewer on the edge of his/her seat. A serial killer (Ted Levine), nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press because he likes to skin his humps , is kidnapping young women, removing portions of their skin and dumping their bodies. Promising F.B.I. trainee Clarice Starling (Jody Foster) is recruited to help find out why. In an attempt to gain insight into the murderer's motivations, Starling interviews incarcerated psychopathic psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), himself convicted of a series of hideous crimes involving murder and cannibalism. The doctor agrees to help Starling, but the information he offers comes at a price. For each piece of insight he gives her, she must answer his probing questions about herself and her past. In order for Starling to see the inside of Buffalo Bill's mind, she must open her own to Lecter's hungry probing. This is not a mystery. Very early on in both the film and Thomas Harris's novel from which it is taken, we are made aware of the killer's identity and motivations. Neither is it a police procedural. The mechanics of detection are incidental to the story's true focus, as is the character of Buffalo Bill himself. The film's central focus is the relationship between Starling and Lecter, and it raises some basic questions about evil itself. By it's nature, the printed page is able to deal with things much more explicitly, unconstrained by time or the necessities of literal presentation. Therefore, what is dealt with in an explicit manner in the novel- Do you think I am evil, Agent Starling? -is made implicit and far more subtle in Ted Tally's excellent screenplay. It is conveyed indirectly and brilliantly through the interaction between Starling and Lecter. It is conveyed as much through their eyes as any words they speak. It is conveyed through a monster's finger, suddenly human and gentle for just a moment as it caresses the hand of a woman. Is Hannibal Lecter evil? Maybe. Is he a pure psychopath , as the doctor in charge of his case asserts? Almost certainly. Is he falling in love with the young woman whom he initially saw as nothing more than an opportunity to relieve his boredom by indulging in a little psychological torture? Well.... The acting in this film is uniformly excellent. Everything about it, from the writing on down to the haunting score, works together to draw the viewer in quickly. The climax, in which Starling blindly stalks the killer in his dark basement while he, in turn, stalks her with the advantage of night-vision goggles, is one of the scariest on film. Watch this one with the lights off! "

It gets you from the begining and will not let you go until you learn every harsh but well needed lesson. I just wish this was a manditory film for high school kids. I especially loved the beautiful scenes toward the end of the film that show edward nortan's character and Edward Furlong's character as little kids on the beach and how much wonder they each had for life. It makes the point that hatred is learned we are not born with it. I just hope those who see it don't take it the wrong way and think this film is glorifying hatred which to most of us it is obviouse enough stateing that hatred is ignorance. I want people to watch this film and have hope for humanity and one day we might unite.If you are in the mood for a movie that will move you and teach you in a very stern way this is highly recommended.

Never in my life have I laughed so hard in a theatre, nor have I ever been to a movie that got such an overwhelming reaction of chestpain-inducing laughter from everyone in attendance. The audience reaction was so overwhelming that it was at difficult to hear the dialogue at times. Parker and Stone are right on the money in their criticisms of all sides of the war on terror: everything, from kneejerk patriotism to Hollywood's delusions that they can change the world with their acting and how the rest of the world gets caught in the crossfire. Their representation of Sean Penn's Iraq visit reminiscence is spot on. Just like South Park, this work is far more intelligent than meets the eye. Parker and Stone have further perfected their formula of taking a relatively serious issue, hitting it with a dash of clever political commentary, and then giving it a generous ladling of tacky sauce. It works every time. The peons who can't see past the bathroom humor and get to the meat of what these guys are trying to say should go back to their American Idols, their Bachelors, and their Apprentices."

Everytime you see it you notice something new, I found myself looking at the expressions on people faces, people not directly focused on but people in the background to see the whole picture. I'm not explaining this very well but what I'm trying to say is that so many of the camp scenes felt so real that I felt like I was looking at a piece of history in the way you look at old photographs and stare at the details of faces and places that no longer exist. The way the clothes hung on peoples bodies the looks on their faces, their shoes, it was like the pictures jumped to life and you were able to see the events before and after the shutter closed."

Right, back to the film. The issue in the film was very contraversial when it was first released and was seen as glamourising drug use. I have never heard so much crap in my entire life! They obviously didn't watch the film. Its very daunting, can be humourous and acted out very well. It portrays the depression of parts of society up in Scotland which also can be reflected to anywhere in the modern world. Outstanding."

S"I loved this movie. The cast of characters is wonderful. It's by far the best film Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Dolly Parton or Darryl Hannah have ever been in-either then or since. I guess it would be considered a chick flick but bring some hankys girls it's a tear jerker. The interaction between the women is fantanstic-each has her own personality, and we see how each one changes and grows, some more than others. Darryl Hannah's character probably the most in my opinion but all the women and Sally Field's husband are marvelous."

I reccomend this movie to everyone. "

It is a heartwarming story about inter- racial relationships, and overcoming tragic losses to become what you have always dreamed of becoming. Julia Stiles Sean Patrick Thomas are jammin'. They portray their characters so well, and are obviously very talented in both acting and dance. The story is well wrote, giving great depth on what really goes on in the real America, outside the glossy Hollywood. Well done Thomas Carter, a brilliant movie. Well done also to the writer(s), and all actors, especially Julia Sean! Absoloutly Brilliant! PS. Sean is a real sizzler, and just for the record I am not Afican American. "

S"One of the best all time movies ever made. I loved it, aboslutly loved it. I just hoped they went into the lives of these great pilot's a bit more. Such as: By the end of WWII Yeager had shot down a total of 13 enemy aircraft.That in 1954 Yeager retired from testing rocket aircraft and returned to military flying only. There is no mentoin at all about Wally Schirra's six orbits in Oct.62. The most exiting details of Gordo Cooper's flight were left out, how he flew his spacecraft back after 34 hours and a ship that all systems were ethier dead or on there way. Pancho Barnes was indeed a test pilot, in 1929 she was flying expermintal aircraft such as the Lockheed J-5. She also owned and operated her own flying circus.The fire that burnt her club to the ground was considered suspicious because the Air Force wanted that land and threatend to condem her club, acting as her own lawer, she won her case and was awarded $414,000. The scene where Yeager loses control of his NF-104 and bails out happened 5 months after Coopers flight and 15 months after NASA moved to Houston, in the movie is is depicted during and before. All in all still one of the best movies ever. "

S'Holocaust movie, but it takes place in present day (not too many flashbacks either, and those are hazy): "Never forget." That\'s the whole movie, but I haven\'t ruined it for you, since the impact is in the delivery. Glorious Van Gogh colors, quirky touches of humor, then hinting entry of unease, and "whomp!" a blow to the chest leaving me dumbfounded, frozen, eyes welled-up--when I got to my car I cried and couldn\'t stop. Wows, huhs, a psychological trip I couldn\'t forget if I tried. Stars Elijah Wood as Jonathan, "the collector," an American Jew who ponders a photo of late grandfather w/mysterious woman from WWII Ukraine and sets on a journey to find her. Hooks up w/makeshift family buisness "Heritage Tours" that guides rich Jews thru Ukraine in search of personal history. Cranky old grandfather Alex drives (tho he claims he\'s blind), Americaphile grandson Alex translates, and Sammy Davis Jr, Jr ("seeing eye bitch") rides along. (historical background, not from movie: after Nazi invasion of Soviet Union, mass killings of Jews were done by mobile units, even by auxiliary police and pogroms conducted by locals...Ukraine, place of movie, was one such place) '

There is great action at the right times and there are a huge amount of famous actors/actresses in this film. Definitly not my favorite, but right up there."

It's your typical shoot em' up flick with Willis playing the macho cop John McClane, who must face off terrorists in an office building 3,000 miles out of his jurisdiction. Solid performances by Willis and Reginald Veljohnson are the film's high points, but the biggest props have to go to Alan Rickman, a relatively unknown actor who played the role of Hans Gruber very convincingly. Overall, Die Hard is the film to watch if you're looking for some good action mixed with a little bit of comedy."

He has delusions of a roommate at Princeton (where he is attending graduate school) and his niece as well as an F.B.I. agent that is supposedly making him a code-breaker to save the world from a nuclear attack in the early '50s. His mental illness is made apparent to him when a psychiatrist takes him to an asylum and gives him electric shocks to try to eradicate the delusions. He has a lifelong struggle and becomes a threat to others. He starts to teach at Princeton still is suffering. He wins a Nobel Prize in 1994 for an economic theory he materialized in the late '40s while he was attending graduate school. It really makes his delusions seem like real people so you can see what schizophrenic people really think is real and their inability to discern reality from imagination. It is a very touching movie as well as a little sad to see this guy suffer so much."

Tarantino make an appearance as Mr. Brown and Lawrence Tierney is a tough but funny crime boss. Michael Madsen's Mr. White cahracter get to have most of the fun (i.e. cutting the ear of of Marvin Nash the captured police officer, and generally playing it cool). The constant backdrop of K-Billy's Super Sounds of the seventies makes the perfect frame for this film. Best Scene: Are you gonna bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite? "

S'A very good remake of a very good series, Scooby-Doo has a talented cast with a variable script. Some of the jokes, including references to the television series, are great, while the fart jokes can be left at the door. Also, cameos from other characters and a great surprise ending make it a five-star. The deleted scenes on the DVD, however, were great and should have been left in!'

S"Excellent Movie! Brilliant acting by Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. A typical Tarintino film - if you liked his other films, you'll love this. Jules (Jackson) and Vincent (Travolta) are basically two hitmen. But they seem to consider their jobs as quite ordinary (as their witty conversations on their way to kill people would suggest). Now, they have to kill a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis) for doing something he shouldn't have to their boss - Marcellus Wallace. There are interesting things that happen along the way. Vincent takes out Marcllus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman), Vincent accidently shoots someone, Jules and Vincent get caught in a robbery and Jules thinks that God rescued him and Vincent from bullets shot at them . . . . . just to name a few!!!!"

S"Munson, I certainly agree with you. Kramer vs. Kramer is a wonderfully touching film, and Justin Henry as the seven year old involved in a custody battle, is brilliant. I think this is one of Hoffman's best films as well. The way his and Meryl Streep's characters are shown as mostly vindictive toward the other, but with an underlying compassion as well as thinking of the child, adds substance to the story. I applaud Kramer vs. Kramer for depicting divorce through a child's eyes so well, that surely even the more hardened of hearts will be affected by it. The best motion pictures do more than merely entertain; they enlighten. Bravo!"

S"What a great movie. It resurrected John Travolta's career and includes some of the most well written and original material in recent memory. You got to love the conversations between Travolta and Samual Jackson. However, this movie is definitely not for everyone. It includes some pretty graphic violence, but none of it is gratuitous. It is also incredibly funny with some of the funniest moments coming as a result of the violence. The soundtrack is one of the best ever."

It was a sad look at our society, but quite thought provoking...Great ending!"

S"Out of all the films I have seen in my life none have ever touched me so deeply and intimatly as American Beauty. This film is my favorite film. I'm not just saying that, it actually changed how I saw things. I related most to Ricky Fitz the young man living next door to the Burnums. The honesty and gorgeouse story are only out shined by the powerful performances given by the best ensemble cast since Magnolia. Everytime Ricky gives the speech on all the beauty in the world I cry. It is so touching and so personal,I cannot see how people cannot be moved by its simple and never before touched message.I am glad this last best picture of the year of this decade was American Beauty. It was the perfect sumation of American life and our new found spirituality. I will always hold this film high as one of the best if not the best ever produced.It will always be in my heart. Sometimes...there's so much beauty...in this world..."
